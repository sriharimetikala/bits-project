Flipkart.com,925076148,Flipkart travel is a scam,"I had booked a flight from New Delhi to Raleigh on 16th July 2021(PNR: 2HJR75). The flight was from Qatar airways and I booked the flight through Flipkart travel. The flight route was New Delhi -> Doha -> Boston -> Raleigh for 6th August 2021. On 18th July 2021, I received an email from Qatar airways that my flight from Boston to Raleigh has been canceled. I contacted Qatar airways and they told me that as the flight was booked through Flipkart, so according to airlines policy Flipkart is responsible for rescheduling the flight. Then I contacted Flipkart and requested a connecting flight from Boston to Raleigh.Customer service executive told me that as the flight is booked under the same PNR, they cant provide a connecting flight from Boston to Raleigh, but they will reschedule the entire flight and will book a new flight from New Delhi to Raleigh with Qatar airways for 6th August 2021 and there will be no charges for rescheduling. I agreed to this and asked them to send the ticket by email. I didn't receive any email on 18th July. The next day, one of the customer executives called me and told me that there is no flight available on 6th August 2021 and we can check flights for 7th and 8th august. Unwillingly, I agreed to this and asked them to send the options available. They sent one option for 8th August 2021 on 19th July 2021 and within 20 minutes I asked them to reschedule to this date. Two hours after my confirmation, I received another call from Flipkart that there are no seats available on that flight and they told me that we will revert with more options. After one hour they called again and told me that no flight is available on specified dates and they asked if I am ok with a flight on 9th August 2021. Reluctantly, I said yes and asked for an itinerary. I did not receive any mail from them after that.The next day morning they called me and told me that there are no flights available till 15th August 2021. After that I checked Flipkart's portal for flights from Delhi to Raleigh between 6th and 8th August 2021 operated by Qatar Airways, I could find 6 flights. When I asked the customer support executive to book one of these flights he started asking for rescheduling charges up to Rs.100000 as the flight prices have hiked in the last two days. Finally, when I asked for a refund they told me that there will be cancellation charges and they can't refund the entire amount. Flipkart is providing no support and is trying to loot money from their customers. If I try to book the same flight today, it will cost me around Rs.265000. They are harassing me for the past 13 days. It's been 13 days that this issue has been raised.Every time I call customer care they tell me that the backend team will contact me within the next 24-48 hours, but I haven't received any response for the past 8 days. I asked for talking with the supervisor and I was told that I will receive a call within the next 2 hours and that didn't happen as well. On asking customer care to send a mail specifying the deadline of the issue resolution, the customer care executive says that they don't have access to send the e-mail. I have been calling customer care 3-4 times a day for the past 13 days regarding this issue.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",0,Negative

My second order was Philips Trimmer QT4011/15 running smoothly after 2 years and 6 months. My third order was Lois Caron watch which is also going great after 2 years. My fourth order was Sony ZX110A wired without mic Headphone which is also going very good after 10 months. My fifth order was Mi Rechargeable Led Lamp which is also going good after 20 days. So, these are the products I had bought from Flipkart 4 out of 5 are going great, the Powerbank one is little bit hit and miss I should have gone for some other. Delivery is also great on Flipkart in orders it indicates around 6 days order to come but, it comes within 4 days and Delivery Staffs are good.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Flipkart Travel is a scam !,"I had booked a flight via Flipkart Travel from YYZ-BOM-YYZ(Toronto-Mumbai-Toronto) on 01/10/2020, for the scheduled travel on 23/12/2020.  Due to the breaking out of the second wave of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, all flights were barred by many countries including India. Hence, British Airways cancelled the flight and informed me on 22/12/2020. Immediately said mail was sent to Flipkart for proceeding with the cancellation and initiation of refund. Even after rigorous follow-ups with them, Flipkart Travel always used to give assurance regarding the refund but till date, they have not refunded our money.Whenever I approached them, they used to insist to contact the airline and get the confirmation mail regarding flight cancellation. I have shared the same multiple times since 22/10/2020. However, they have not acted upon the cancellation. As per Flipkart's request, we even contacted British Airways also, but they mentioned that the flight has been booked with the travel agent(Flipkart), therefore I need to contact Flipkart only for resolution. Now, after more than 5 months on 09/06/2021, when I asked about the status, one of the Flipkart representatives mentioned that you are no show on the flight and hence only Airport taxes can be refunded which is a shock for me.When the British Airways flights were not operating from Toronto to India on 23/12/2020 and the airline also confirmed via mail, there was no relevance in mentioning no show on the flight. And this was been communicated to Flipkart and was rigorously followed up. However, as per my opinion, Flipkart has not timely acted from their end, and in turn, I'm the sufferer.This issue has disturbed me financially and mentally for the last 6 months.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

But Flipkart delivered formal shoes to me, see attached pic order 1 to check what I got. I requested for replacement but the seller was out of stock for the same product so Flipkart cancelled the replacement and refund the amount. Till here nothing was too serious about this issue. I raised this request to Flipkart and their executive call me, she assured me that if I place the order again when the product is available then we will make sure that you will get the same product this time, I just need to inform Flipkart once that I have placed the order for the same product once again.With the order ID OD121982078287069000 I again placed an order for the same product and informed that same executive and she told me that She passed the information to the seller and I am gonna get the right product this time. But Flipkart or I don't know people who deliver the product who makes this fraud, that I got wrong shoes again. Same Brand Box, Same Brand Tags but different color, different style. See image ""Order 2"" to check what I got on the second order.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",0,Negative
Flipkart.com,925076148,Think before buying Apple products from Flipkart,"Flipkart claims itself to be a brand partner of Apple. But this is a big lie.I bought an Apple airpods from Flipkart and found a weird sound coming from airpod case while opening and closing.This started after 4 days of delivery only. So I called flipkart support and asked for replacement as the product came with 7days replace/return policy.But they said reach to apple we are brand partners with them, they will take care of the issue in product.I reached apple they said first we are not partner with them. Second they said they will charge to fix this.After that I have exhausted all my patience while getting my issue resolved with flipkart and after a month I gave up. They are doing nothing, they are just changing their statement in each call. Every guy comes with its own copy of policy.I will advise don't buy expensive product from online platform as they are just a platform between seller and buyer (Flipkart mentioned this to me, i am not making this up), in most cases they can not do anything if somthing goes wrong and will start redirecting you to service center.At least when you buy from physical store they take some accountability.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

They raised a ticket for the issue and somebody from Flipkart cald me . They gave me nearest Kent dealer contact and asked me to send the product to them for service . This happened in December 2020. Immediately the ticket was closed saying issue resolved. Nobody contacted me again checking if it was resolved . The Kent dealer said they canât do anything for the product and asked me to courier it Chennai Kent service center. As it was glass kettle they charged me rs.650 courier charges for it . The product was sent in early Jan 2021. After a month I contacted the nearest dealer asking for updated . He said they will replace the product but the glass one is not available and only stainless steel is there but it cost extra money and I had to pay 600 more to get it . I said I canât pay extra money , if you donât have the same product. You can give my money back . They said wil discus and let you know . This happened around Jan 15th 2021. Itâs been more than 2 months , nobody picks my call . Then again I contacted Flipkart. A week before . In this week I received 10 calls from Flipkart, asking the same question again and again . They will say we have escalated the issue to higher authorities you will receive call from them in few hours but no one will call back.

I would suggest not to use flipkart supercoins on their website and will be better to get redemption by visiting the nearby stores mentioned in the supercoin section.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

This brings me to assure, deaf people are operating the business, who are still working call to hear basis, some where in the warehouse, one says GREY! other hears GREEN!

Its a huge green cloth with no markings at all on this. However as per their return protocols, brand/product name has to be on article, despite it was`nt ever delivered in such a format.Day 5 - MY Orders tab under my account, has no options left either for a replacement or return, Also contact customer care option is also exhausted maybe because I have talked to them once. Now appears I have to live with the Green only as they deliver what they have in stock, irrespective of their depiction on   website portal and what customer requires.If they cant understand what difference can colors make in a critical world of photography.This is having me to miss on my client`s work schedules.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Best for shopping in india,Hey friendsSince im using flipcart for over 3 years I'm going to share a honest opinion.i think that flipcart is better than amazon not because of just it is an indian app but because of the service they provide.i have bought so many products from Flipkart and I am completely satisfied with it.The best purchase I made so far is ( in case of money saving) is puma shoes which was worth of 3000 and I got it for only 1200.bang rs 1800 savings. Though I had to wait for 3 months for the offer but its worth it. I got it on diwali sale.i have also bought mobiles like realme x2 pro and redmi note 5 pro and other electronic stuff like pendrives and memory cards and im not disappointed. although if you want to buy anthing on flash sale you probably won't get it. Flipkart needs to work on it.and also flipcart needs to work on their customer services.its not bad but they need to improve it in regards to the refunding and that stuff.The good point is they provide wide range of products and covers almost every corner of country( I think that) . And its app version is better than website its easy to use and now they are adding many regional languages.for the product quality im completely satisfied. I got every product in perfect form. At least I got don't know about others. I would suggest you to buy products from popular companies for good quality and also check the review for the product before purchasing it.in case of delivery I won't say it is amazing like you get product within 2 or 3 days but it is satisfactory ( nowdays its may be late cause of covid 19) . You will get your product within 7 days. So thats it thanks flipcart.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.,2,Positive

Mid-June, I got contact with Air India and Emirates airlines. Both say that, please talk to Flipkart regarding refund, then again, I talked to Flipkart, they talked to air-lines for refund, from both sides, they were doing the same for 2 months. I was continuously contacted by both of them. the end of July, again I mailed to Flipkart regarding this issue, she replied me to cancel that ticket, but in the Flipkart app, they were not any option to cancel it, so from Flipkart team, they canceled one of my ticket and they said you have to wait 15 days for refund and 15 days for canceling the process. Then I called on 4th Nov 2020. From that day till now, I am still waiting for my refund. Now, One customer care said, "" the applicable refund, credit shell, free rescheduling, or any other guidelines shall be shared with you within 15 days, "". Another customer care said to me ""it will take up to 120 days"". May you please tell me, how you provide your services to your customers?Even then I didn't get any update, any cancellation message from flipkart on this. After communicating with Air india & Emirates Airlines, its being confirmed that the amount has already been refunded to Flipkart. Since then I am continuously following up with flipkart team using calls, e-mails, but the response is pathetic. The customer care puts my calls on hold for a long-long time and commits that the issue will be taken care on priority and amount will come in 24 hrs. Today it's been more than one Year, I still did not get my money back. I am completely frustrated with Flipkart and it's disgusting process. The amount is huge and important for me. The payment medium was Credit card and the due date has already been reached. Bank is applying penalty and don't know who is going to compensate it?Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Samsung AC - 100 %; Flipkart CS - Useless 0%,"I am currently experiencing one of the worst Customer Service from Flipkart with their CS and Escalation teams showing no humanity or customer service traits to solve my problem which, I pray to God, no one should endure.It all started when I purchased Samsung 1.5 Ton 5 star rated inverter type model AC - 2 qty from the Flipkart website for both of our bedrooms. The product was delivered on October 21, 2020. Flipkart's website shows that they would send a ""Brandâs authorized service engineer to carry out the installation."" A couple of people came and installed the AC and we also purchased from them stabilizers that would perfectly compliment the air conditioners.The air conditioners worked perfectly well until January 13, 2021. On that fateful day, one of the air conditioners(indoor part) fell off from the wall dragging the Stabilizer along with it. The machine was not even running at that time. Close to the wall was our bed. While the indoor unit fell on my 12-year-old son, the hefty stabilizer fell on me. The indoor unit also damaged the 5 feet X 6 feet canvas painting of my children hanging on the wall. It took a lot of time for me to come out of the shock.My initial move was to contact Samsung. To my surprise, I found that neither of my Samsung air conditioners was registered with them. They informed that the installation was not carried out by Samsung's personnel. For this reason, they denied providing any sort of assistance since the problem was not with the machine but due to poor installation procedure carried out by the ""Brandâs authorized service engineer"" sent by Flipkart.From then on, I am running from pillar to post to get this issue resolved but none of the Flipkart employees, be it regular customer service agents or the escalation team, care to resolve the issue. I have made and received many calls but none of the Flipkart personnel with whom I spoke had the intent to solve the issue.Leave alone showing intent to help me on this issue. When I called Flipkart initially and explained to them what had happened, they did not even were showing basic humanitarian concern to know about the safety of me and my kid. Kudos to Flipkart for letting me realize the divinity of customer service. After so many conversations with them, as of January 16, 2020, at 8:00 PM they are asking me to contact either Samsung or the ""Brandâs authorized service engineer"" sent by Flipkart. I do not find any logic in calling either of them as the  ""Brandâs authorized service engineer"" that was sent to mount the air conditioner was not my choice but Flipkart's. And calling Samsung is out of the question because the issue itself is not about the product's performance.I am attaching the pictures of the product showing the current scenario. If at all Flipkart wants to resolve this issue, I want some higher authority that can put himself/herself in my shoes and contact me with a solution. Surprisingly, it took them just a couple of seconds to remove the funds from my account but takes ages to find a resolution and I still wait for this multi-dollar company to help this simple man that had spent his hard-earned money.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Even though the third party agrees on the defect, the flipkart technical team needs to agree upon if they don't you need to again initiate the process and the cycle continues.

This fraudulent activity can very well be established  from Flipkart Status Screenshorts/ Call/chat/Email logs which will be required to be produced by the Flipkart  in the  court of law for this willful cheating of Customers by the Flipkart.In view of the foregoing, it is once again requested to ensure early refund not later than 07 days for the amount paid against the approved Return/Refund request lodged by me on 07th Nov 2020  failing which I shall be constrained to seek refund of amount and compensation for the undue harrasment  caused to me  due to the Fraudulent  behaviour of Flipkart in creating a new Return  Request dtd 24th Nov 2020 illegally merely to deny a LEGITIMATE REFUND.Pl acknowledge receipt of this communicationThanksSandeep SinghRefund ID: 12202015750638654242 dtd 07.11.202009.12.2020Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

They deliverd a kingstone sd card. the worst part is that the invouce which came with the item was not for the profuct delivered. The item I bought had a lifetime warranty.So the invoice is a necessity. So because of this, I raised a return request on the day itself of deliver.and informed their customer also over the phone. I asked them for an exchange gor the item I ordered.Also although the item I received was not that I ordered, I told them I could use the item if I could get the right invoice. both these request were denied by the.I kept on calling them and mailing them for the next 2 weeks to know the status of the issue. But nothing materialized. Every time I call they ask me what the issue is and I had to explain the issue all over again.The answer was all the same.Someone will contact you in 2-3 days.initially, this somebody used to call, but never gave a. solution.And latet on , that also stopped very unprofessional way.As some other reviewers have mentioned, This is like a Government office where they keeping on postponing and never find a solution.One year ag, I had purchased a blue star air conditioner from them. You wouldn't believe what I recieved.Got a fully damaged unit like it was from a junkyard which was full of dents on the outdoor unit, oil had leaked  from the compresssor which means there was no gas, and the indoor unit had parts missing.Fortunately, I had called the blue star authorized technicians for installatikn.They gave me a written report that the mavhine was damaged one. with all these papers I threatened them with legal actionif the case was not resolved immediately.So they budged. in that transaction I lost some money also, paying the technician who came to uninstal the AC. there is no coustomer service for them.they will offer you a very attractive price for what they sell and will lure you intro buying from them, But what you get they will decide.I don't know whether the item I recieved is genuine, becuse I have not opened the sealof the item hoping for them to take it back. it is a month now since I bought it. In the hope that they would to take it back, I bought what I wanted from another site after waiting for a week for the Diwali sale.and becuase I did notwant to deal with them anymore.I went ahead and purchased the card from them.at the time because theirs was  the best price and it was urgent for me.It was better that I wanted for the diwali sale and purchased it ftom a reliable site.They are cheats.Especially in these difficult times, how can a suoposed to be a reliable Indian company like flipkart cheat the coustomers of their hard-earned money.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Do not buy mobile from Flipkart against exchange.,"Dear Flipkart support executive team, I have ordered Samsung Galaxy F41 of 18/10/2020 on Flipkart with the exchange of a one-year-old OPPO K3 handset in very good condition IMEI NO:868649041625935(IMEI-1) and order number generated as OD119987459941701000. The handset was delivered on 21/10/2020 by Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx at around 13:00 to 14:00 hrs afternoon time. He has checked  OPPO K3 handset  IMEI NO:868649041625935(IMEI-1) with all respect and cross-checked IMEI of the handset as mentioned in order invoice inclosed. He appraised the good condition of my  OPPO K3 handset and collected the original charger adaptor and data cable along with Handset Cover provided by OEM duly mentioning that all such accessories required while the exchange of the product. Though I was at the office at that time my spouse asked him that these accessories are not required by Flipkart except handset but he insisted to collect all such accessories. So my spouse confirmed me the same on a phone call and I asked her to hand over all such accessories as useless for us as we got a new handset. Afterward Shri Manoj Kumar the Flipkart Wish master has handed over  Samsung Galaxy F41 IMEI/Serial No: 350265511557139 to my spouse and has taken the old OPPO K3 handset IMEI NO:868649041625935(IMEI-1) along with all the above accessories.In the evening I got the SMS from Flipkart backend at 18:24 hours regarding pick-up rejected(product mismatched) of OPPO K3 handset  Tracking id FMPR0138822260 due to details mismatch(Screenshot of SMS received from Flipkart backend at 18:24 hours attached) 05 hours after delivery of Product and collection of the old handset. Afterward, I had a telephonic conversation with  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx(call recording attached of 2.1 MB file no AUD-20201021-WA0002_ attached with this email) and while asking why product exchange pick-up rejected(product mismatched) of OPPO K3 handset he replied that he himself canceled the product and paid the exchange value of the  OPPO K3 handset of Rs6900/-as he required the handset because of handset good condition. When I asked him about his unethical/misconduct of product exchange cancellation he did not express any guilty feelings of his unethical misconduct. You requested to listen to the call recording carefully.After this conversation, I have checked the Flipkart app and the thing was confirmed that the pick-up OPPO K3 handset was canceled and the amount of Rs6800/- paid in cash as I did not pay anything in this transaction in cash towards rejection of the OPPO K3 handset hence I have realized that the pick-up  OPPO K3 handset had canceled purposefully by  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx. Afterward, I had called back him again and asked him to return the handset to the company( call recording attached of 3.2 MB file no AUD-20201021-WA0003_with this email) then he apologizes and asked me to speak with his Supervisor and both apologized for Shri Manoj Kumar misconduct. You requested to listen to the call recording carefully.That's Why Flipkart Wish master insisted to collect accessories of the OPPO K3 handset to use the handset duly maintaining in his custody unethically as well illegally. In such a scenario of  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx may misuse OPPO K3 handset 868649041625935(IMEI-1) duly making fraudulent/ransom calls. Hence I sincerely request you to kindly take appropriate action in this regard so that such instances will never have occurred in the future. You know very well that how serious the matter is and the reputation of Flipkart put on the burner because of such unethical & illegal act by your personnel duly misusing power/access provided by the company in such a scenario.So if  OPPO K3 handset IMEI NO:868649041625935(IMEI-1) is misused for making fraudulent/ransom calls in future then  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx, EKART &Flipkart will be solely responsible as do not take any appropriate action even almost 04 days since my complaint raised on Flipkart as on 21/10/2020.To avoid such instances in the future to provide the strict provision of OTP customer mobile number to validate such transaction(cancellation of Pickup of Old appliances and payment of balance amount) if any if required. If any problem occurs while generating OTP or delivering OTP to customer mobile due to technical reason/network outage then the same may be created by Flipkart customer care and after duly authentication same may be advised to the customer for completing such transaction. if the required OTP is not provided by the customer then the whole transaction should be canceled and a refund should be initiated duly charging penal amount if applicable.At last, my humble request to take all such necessary action in this regard to return  OPPO K3  868649041625935(IMEI-1) to the seller and refund amount if any paid by Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx and confirm status as successfully picked up instead of existing; pickup canceled, and paid exchange amount in cash. I also requested to take consider fact that  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar is a very sincere & dedicated person. He delivers the products in my area for a long time with full dedication. But he committed a mistake without thinking about the consequences of such an unethical act in need of financial crisis post COVID19.So take only affirmative action to avoid such instances in the future instead of any action in vengeance.PS: Please go through all attached audio and .pdf files duly supporting my point of view in this incident of unethical cancellation of OPPO K3 Handset exchange by Flipkart Wish master without customer knowledge and unethical possession of handset with Flipkart wish to master.with regardsyours sincerelyMUDIT AGARWALMOB:700704xxxxFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

But sorry to note there is constant deterioration of service under foreign management. I never remember Flipkart failed to deliver an ordered item in last 10 years of buying. But recently I had placed OD120055373675841000 for 5 liter hand sanitizer on 26th October 2020. Delivery time was mentioned by 4th November. But after waiting till 5th November, received a mail from Flipkart informing extension of delivery time till 11th November. But even on 6th November the item was not shipped. Contacting customer support could not get any confirmation to receive the item on time. Hence today I have cancelled the order and placed fresh order on Amazon. My place is located near Kolkata, but most of the advertised items in Flipkart shows un-deliverable in my area as if it is in North East or some remote locality.

Flipkart.com,925076148,A Horrible tale- washing machine from flipkart,"Recently I(unfortunately) purchased a new Samsung washing machine( Samsung 6.2 kg ActivWash+ Fully Automatic Top Load Grey) and paid the amount online under exchange.The exchange price was Rs 1800/- for my old Samsung Top loading fully automatic machine.When the new machine arrived at my place, my old samsung washing machine was washing clothes and in use daily. So, the person waited as he saw it working.However later he called to someone and said there is rust on cover, so price is Rs 475/- and asked me to pay balance Rs 1325/-.  I tried contacting FK support and they informed me to place new order(i.e. cancel the order). I was astonished for this input.In good faith I paid cash Rs 1325 as new machine was as door step but protested strongly as it's cheating when old machine is working and washing clothes. But he did not care and it was like predecided from his interactions on phone to fail the machine(& not pass it). To me it was like cheating.I provided a pungent comment on the exchange document and shared with FK.Then next day, Samsung Service engineer visited and he said internally the machine is damaged. The photo of his findings on new machine were shared with FK. After sharing the visit details(fortunately I took job card photo), FK realised that visit is over but the service engineer did not punch those details in system. He called center and infront of him he asked me to go for cancellation/ refund in the FK application. With no choice left, have to apply for refund.So, FK said we will refund the machine amount & cash but Rs 475 will be FK coupons. I asked them give my old working machine back, but FK refused. Already paid Rs 100 for pickup.I am left with no washing machine as the new machine is damaged piece and my old working machine is taken back.So FK cheated me twice:cost of old working samsung machine was forced at Rs 475 when in local shop/market it typically fetches Rs 1000 - 1200Providing defective new washing machineApart from that, pain of contacting FK support, explaining the problem to FK support engineer again and again with no end as every time new person comes on callEven escalation mechanism did not help as they said why did you accept to pay the amount by cash, that means its your fault.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

As the one year warranty was over, had searched in whole Mumbai for purchase of a compatible remote. But no remote available is compatible with this brand. After repeated correspondence from February 2020 with an unresponsive customer care of  MarQ flipkart, it was informed in October 2020 that the company does not produce any spare remote which can be purchased by the customer. As no remote in market or MI phone is compatible with this unique brand of A.C, i am unable to use this A.C since November 2019 and now only option is to discard this unusable junk of equipment purchased with a good amount of money.Flipkart needs to look into this matter. The customer care of flipkart has simply passed onto MarQ and this brand is irresponsible towards customer support.So if this is the condition with the remote, just imagine the condition if there is any issue with the electronic parts in the MarQ A.C.So be careful in investing money in this product.

But mobile got suddenly Off without any accidental damage. When I raised for claim assistance Jeeves consumer services insisted me to to pay. 500 towards Processing fee. I believe why do we need to pay to avail these these  processing fees to avail the service instead I can get it from local service centre. Then jeeves returned my mobile without doing servicing when I denied to Pay the processing fees.I filed my grievance in Public grievance system portal Grievance Status for registration number: DARPG/E/2020/19062 seeking for action. then Director accepted my grievance I believe there  is Sense in  it. Then he reached  National Consumer Helpline to file a complaint on behalf of me.Grievance Number: 2241207.Still Jeeves is very rigid and insisted to pay. I have provided all my Order details to Jeeves and honorable helpline.After dropping couple of reminders Jeeves left from the picture and Flipkart said apologies and initiated 70% of Mobile cost which is Rs.6299 .and collected by bank details to transfer. to close the issue.

Flipkart.com,925076148,The worst online shopping platform,The worst experience you could possibly get from a online shopping platform. I am traveling abroad and I ordered 3 rain jackets and only received 1. I reported the problem 15 minutes after the delivery was done and the agent (who does not know how to do his job probably cause of the lack of proper training)put in the wrong request. I requested for a manager callback a guy who doesn't speak English called me so he said someone else will call me back. After a day someone who speaks English called me and he didn't want to take any responsibility. He first blamed the agent for putting in the wrong request and that he had to cancel the request and place a new request. After cancelling the request he stated that the merchandise is no longer available and ended up blaming the seller for their incompetence and Flipkart can't do anything about it since it is the sellers fault. I purchased through Flipkart and not the seller (but I wish I had purchased through the seller directly or a different website). I have nothing to do with the seller and I don't care who they are because I purchased the merchandise through Flipkart and paid Flipkart for it. He finally ended up saying the same thing over and over again blaming the seller and that Flipkart won't do anything but just request for a refund. I am leaving in three days and  I still don't have my merchandise or my refund.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.,0,Negative

The expected date of delivery was Aug 19, 2020. I have waited for this for a month. On Aug 11th, I got a update saying the item is packed and shipped by seller and will reach me intime. To my surprise, item was not delivered on Aug 19th. From there, every day I call the customer care, they say wait until 9 PM and it will be delivered. This happened for 7 days. There is no other way to escalate my case with Flipkart management and the customer care is taking a ride on me by telling new reasons everytime I call them. Finally I asked them on Aug 28th that if they cannot deliver it, then cancel and refund my money. You know, the customer case said that both are not possible and I have to wait infinitely and no other option.I have mailed my situation to Flipkart management(got their email through some friends) and no response to my 3 emails to them. Then I have to draft a formal complaint to their CEO and after 4 days someone from Flipkart called me and told that the issue got escalated and they will resolve it immmediately. They made me wait for another 3 days to tell that the item was not deliverable due to some issue with the seller and I have to cancel. WHen I agreed to the same, you know, they recorded that I have cancelled the item. And it took another one week to process the refund. Today I got back my money without any interest from Flipkart, after 54 days. The main points are customer care is not transperant and genuine with customers, management does not care customers, no standard operating mechanism left to customers for escalatons. This is totally unprofessional way of dealing with customers. I may not buy next time from Flipkart.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",0,Negative

If you think Flipkart too follows policies akin to Amazon(where a product can be returned without mentioning the reason), then you are mistaken.Think twice before placing an order, keep a screen shot of the order and copy of the invoice for taking up an issue with them. The customer service executives do not have ready access to invoice and ask for our support.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Flipkart and OmniTech Fraud,"The 2 together are indulging in fraud. I ordered a Bosch washing machine via. Flipkart with the seller being OmniTech retail. The seller does only replacements, which is fine for a high ticket item. The machine arrived within stipulated timeline along with the Bosch guys who came for installation. The machine, when the box was opened by Bosch people had some broken parts and the door wasn't locking. They gave me their paper saying this isn't installable and needs to be replaced. When I tried replacing on flipkart, the only option available is return and refund. The process was initiated and then converted into a replacement 4-5 days later. In the meantime, needing a washing machine and convinced the one I've is going back, I bought a new one. Now they say only replacement and no return - my question is why did you allow for a return only and not a replacement only option when I was returning it! First you deliver a broken products(happens), then you force me to return it and then convert it into a replacement 5 days later because the seller doesn't say so! The fault, I believe, squarely lies with the Flipkart team and their process design people - had the option for replacement been available, I'd have taken it up and none of this would be happening!

However Jeeves informed me that they do not have any update from flipkart on my order yet. Once the order details from Flipkart to Jeeves is received, only then they can send the technician for installation and demo of the product.I have been chatting and calling flipkart multiple times from the time this product got delivered. Flipkart customer service only says that they will escalate this issue and nobody helps after this.Flipkart customer service agents over the phone only say that they can only escalate and cannot do much as they have very limited authority.I was also misguided that this product does not qualify for free installation.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Company that does not stand by its commitment,Recently in a sale I purchased a TV from flipkart which was also delivered to me on time. But my nightmare started when there was a defect found in the TV which was also highlighted by their own technician who came to fit the TV. On asking for a replacement (which is very well mentioned on their site) due to a malfunctioning product they asked me to take a refund (EMI for that product already charged by the bank to me during this time) as the product is out of stock. Somehow they don't mention this on the site while selling their item. And guess what the seller of the product is their very own  OmniTech Retail. They purposely kept buying time so that I not only loose on the introductory price but also on the initial extended warranty of the TV which was only for 6th to 10th Aug.I keep blaming myself on why I chose this sick site for purchasing a product which currently lies at my place which is of no use and also burnt so much of my time in dealing with their customer service which lacks knowledge skills.Moreover now they don't even let me share the reviews of the product on the site. I have snapshots to proove this and it gets submitted at my end yet never appears to all. Atleast by reading my review someone would aave their money and valuable time dealing with idiots.Moreover someone from Hisense calls me and tries to negotiate the ratings I have given on the product by offering me a repair on the problem (not replacement) .

I bought a âFlipkart perfect homes Viola Engineered Wood Queen Hydraulic Bedâ, selling price of the product was Rs. 23890 without discount I got it for Rs 14090.After 8 months of use the head portion support went down. When I checked it, all of the fitting whuch was made has came out ( nut bolts ).Very same day I raised a complaint against the product since product was still under warranty.Flipkart took the request and arranged the authorized partner to visit and check the status. The visiting person agreed saying that the product had fitting issue. My reply was âthey were your people who made the fitting' how would I know how fitting has to be done.The person called his boss and provided him images of bed. Then the dealer spoke to me and said â Sir we can't do anything since the bed is brokenâ then I answered him The product is still under warranty, why can't you do anything. Next thing what he said is sir you could informed after installation then I replied âproblem has occurred after 8 months, why do you expect complaint from me after installation â then he said sir I will provide my update to flipkart. You can talk to them.After 1 hour I received a message saying dealer has completed its visit to your place. Sorry seller is unable to provide return request.I called flipkart then agents tells me sir if there is any material issue with product we can't do anything then i asked them âwhy are providing warranty on product?â How does it make sense? If product has some issue then there is no repair or refund on product and the next movement my request was closed.All I want to say do not get into trap of flipkart.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Worst website,"I shop everything I need online. I have used various playforms like Myntra, Amazon, Ajio, Club Factory, Nykaa, Just Herbs and Flipkart. And let me tell you Flipkart has been the worst.Firstly, the user interface is pathetic.Suppose you liked a top and you want to see colours of that top.For Myntra and Amazon you get to see colours of same product in single window.But in flipkart, there is a whole different entry for difeerent colours of the same product.This makes it so difficult and time consuming to shop there.Also the filters are very few to actually find what we need. Even if you filter out, the products will be mixed. There is no clear separation.Coming to the products, I had once ordered Puma sports shoes which out to be fake and when I complained about the same, they simply said you can exchange or return but that is real product. Point is not about exchanging but about flipkart sending fake products with Puma tagging.Now about exchange policy, that is fine just like any other platform.It is free and money is transferred back to you.But not all products can be returned.It depends on different sellers.Products can take anywhere between 3-15 days depending upon the seller and market demand.Customer support services are really bad. You have to call them atleast 10 times before they actually answer.Even after that it is not sure if they will solve your query.There are many sellers who also upload fake pictures and there is no mechanism to verify the genuineness.Overall, bad experience.Please choose Myntra or Amazon anyday over Flipkart.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Next day he called me multiple times and rudely told me to cancel the return request. He sent me message saying the same. I informed Flipkart about it and asked for refund. Flipkart completely ignored my request.Later that day I found that the product sent to me was returned by someone else(there was a return sticker on the box). I requested for a refund again as I lost trust on the seller, Flipkart ignored again.Meanwhile, Flipkart sent me a mail asking for a second payment for the returned good. I talked to a Flipkart agent who confirmed that I have to pay. It was the final straw. I told them I'll take legal action for consumer exploitation as they charged me twice for the same product, only then they retracted.I should have got compensation for this type of harrassment. I could let go of it all if the product I received was fully functional. Even the second product is defective.Hardware is cheap and flimsy, makes an ugly sound when turned on, sound is still defective (only one speaker plays), gets slow with handful of software.Windows is cracked version and needs reactivation in every 30 days.Conclusion: worst experience ever. I am done buying expensive products from Flipkart.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",0,Negative

Flipkart.com,925076148,Poor Overall Service,"The main reason we shop on Flipkart(or Amazon, etc) is so that, if there's a problem, we have an unbiased party that can mediate. After all, most sellers do have their own websites.Unfortunately, Flipkart is quite useless when it comes to resolving problems. Any idiot can sell; the quality of a vendor is revealed when there's an issue with the sale, right?In my case, a 53K treadmill proved defective(and fraudulent); I highlighted the issue to Flipkart within 3 days, but Flipkart couldn't/didn't help; now, I am stuck with the product.Equally bad, or possibly worse, is the customer service on Flipkart that one has to navigate in such cases. I don't think the reps are dumb. More likely, either management directives are confused, or software the reps are provided with is poor - one keeps getting repeated requests for information already provided. In my case, I have probably received over 25 emails, all quite meaningless(""We realize the importance of the issue. blah, blah, blah."" We would like to thank you for your patience. blah, blah, blah."").Are they using BOTS?Calling on the telephone is even worse; I usually end up losing my temper with the idiocy that I encounter.I really wanted to encourage an Indian operation, but it must be worth encouraging.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Return & Refund of my order,"My Order Id is OD118704806658004000. I had ordered a Cello 50L Air Cooler, which was delivered to me on May 25th 2020. I had raised a request for a return & refund on the same day.The refund request was accepted and was given a date of June 12th as the pick up. Considering the current situation, while the date was far off, I waited.There was no update on June 12th and I contacted customer care on 14th. I was told that by 19th it will be picked up. However nothing happened. From then on I have got dates of 21st June/24th June/29th June and 30th June. The customer care personnel tell me the issue is escalated and I will get a call back. No senior has even once called me back.They are marking the issue as resolved after a few days and I have been reopening it 3-4 times now. I have asked them to change the status of the order to refund accepted, which is also not happening. I want my money back!Today is 30th of June. Despite multiple follow ups and assurance by your customer care agents nothing has been done about the pickup or refund.

Upon opening the order I was shocked to see that the product inside was completely different, my original order was replaced with a broken multi-plug adapter. Had reported the issue as soon as I got the product delivered so that this could be traced back. The packing was torn from inside and a Replacement was ordered on 18th.I got a message on 20th June, that my replacement order(Replacement ID 12101893256625122777) was rejected by the seller. I am really shocked at this, I don't care if it is the seller or the delivery executive or the middleman in between handling the parcel who did this fraud, I simply need a replacement or refund of this product. Why will the seller or delivery executive accept that they did the fraud and have been replacing products for customers?The rejection of the replacement is a slap on my face and a message that I did a petty theft of a product worth Rs. 2599 and a question mark on myself on choosing Flipkart. Please don't ruin this relationship just because you don't have any control over your supply chain.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Flipkart caused more mental agony than Coronavirus,"Flipkartrt, @Jeeves, and Nokia have caused more mental agony than Coronavirus! Explaining my horrendous experience as follows. I recently purchased a Nokia 43-inch television TV through flipkart. I had very high hopes about this purchase as it a new launch from Nokia and the features looked good on paper.The agony started after I took the delivery. I found that the USB port was faulty hence raised a replacement request from Flipkart. Flipkart scheduled a tech visit to ascertain the issue which turned to be a nightmare. I have a kid at home and we are extremely cautious about strangers walking in during this time of Pandemic. The Guy from Jeeves was horrible, he did not know what needs to be done nor there was any solution despite spending almost 2 hours in the house. The very next day Jeeves arranged some other technician for inspection, this time I was hoping for a resolution as my 10-day replacement was coming to end. To my surprise, after the inspection, I received a message from Jeeves saying that the tech visit could not be completed due to some reason.As I am writing this review, my replacement period is over. The only takeaway from this are a) Ridiculous service and torture by Jeeves and their staff b) Flipkartâs laggard approach for resolution sometimes feel that they are intentionally doing it to slow the replacement process c) Lesson not to trust a failed brand like NokiaI have been purchasing from Flipkart for more than 10 years and this one experience has caused enough damage hence I would refrain from purchasing anything from them and also would discourage my friends and family.#Nokia43IncTV #NokiaFailedbrand #Flipkart #FlipkartNolongerCredible #Jeeves Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Very good online shopping,"Flipkart is the no.1 shopping app as I experienced from last 2 years.the quality of products in flipkart are also very very good. Even their delivery is also very nice compared to other shopping sites.Obe thing I appreciate flipkart is they will provide return and replacement policies for almost all products which is actually very good point. For clothes, shoes they will provide around 30 days return policy and for electronic accessories like mobiles and headphones etc they will provide 10 days replacement and return policy. But once they made a mistake.that is I ordered an arduino uno electronic circuit board with set of jumper wires. But at the delivery time I got only the jumper wires in the box but there was no arduino uno board in that box. We raised the complaints so many times but the issue was not at all resolved. So I kindly request flipkart team don't repeat the same thing. Another good point of flipkart is they will provide flipkart pay later option for the customers. By which the customer can by the product and pay the amount next month 10th. They have even provided flipkart pay later services for me of rupees 5500 but for some customers they will also provide 7000 rupees flipkart pay later option.

A technician visit was scheduled on 30th May to check the product for return. It was surprising that technician visit was arranged next day but for installation they kept me waiting.

If you will talk about quality no one can count on it and claim it to be genuine. Flipkart is adding the dealers without having their proper background check and their outlet infection. It just wants to double its revenue by increasing the dealer's count.You never get the true information in your account regarding your order refund our delivery.

When you call them then they simply say sorry and assure that will be delivered and give you some other date but no information changes in your account.After a couple of days before your delivery, you find your order is canceled. You never did it then who? You make a call in a hurry and get to know that the order is being canceled by the dealer and when you ask for the reason they have no clue.Refund policy: It' simply 1 to 15 days prior that forgets about it.

This thing happen after installation 1 day.Second one i bought crompton celling fan after installing sound coming from motor they accept the returns but also flipkart doong big scam in return policy.After return my product is still not dispatched from warehouse only showing code like hmh ihm hnh example like this they are waiting for fan receive after that they resolve the issue in same fan from his engineer and same product they will dispatches.So before ordering any product be careful.One more scam is price they keeping high price on product and after some discount they showing original MRP price customers think that they are giving discount but they didnât. They are taking MRP.Thank You!When i giving 1 star mouth shut is restricting. Option is only you can give 3 or above star what the digital market all are same.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",1,Negative

Flipkart.com,925076148,Extremely bad service. Beware of their loot,"I have ordered an iphone SE from flipkart on 20 may, the day it was launched on flipkart, with the dellivery date promised as 27 may. However, the product reached nearest hub by saturday ( 23 may) and since then its been lying there, instead of being delivered early, fail to understand this slow pace of executing orders. Second issue is nobody from your team called to ask that what time suits you for delivery ( this is the minimum one would expect from an ecommerce company, even small players can accomodate that) . And, when asked from customer care, the only reply is wait till maxium time 7 pm, apart from that we dont know anything, neither we can help you. I mean this behaviour is strange, ekart is your in-house logistics company and you are not able to contact them? There are no active contact numbers available for this logisctics company. I have asked the delivery at my office location and you want the person to just wait irrespective of his days schedule, you are incapable in giving the idea of time when it will be delivered. Pathetic service.They failed to deliver on 27th May and promised for 29th May as a revised date, but again they failed to deliver the product. Now they will again give new date, but not sure how they will act on it.Flipkart vouch for its service, faster delivery and other things, but seeing this response, it seems far from being true.Flipkart is now an walmart company and with such a huge name as parent, this service is a real issue. Your company wants to compete with players like Amazon, but Amazon is way better then this crap company.Final words - Stay away from this company and save your precious time.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Great app for shopping,So this is my genuine review for flipkart. So I've been using flipkart since 2017 and it never disappointed me whether in terms of their user interface. Or their delivery I like flipkart more than Amazon there are several reasons for this. But 1st reason is because of its user interface it looks more attractive ya I know I doesn't matter a lot but still I like how flipkart website looks. Talking about shipping of products so it's just fine both Amazon and flipkart are equal in my locality. And the thing I like the most in flipkart is that mostly all newly launched electronic gadgets are launched in flipkart which gives us a early access to the product. And last but not the least thing is their 24/7 customer care which is always there to help us out and their service to customers are really good.

I often find myself walking out of the shops to find that they are incredibly frustrated because of disgruntled employees who both try not to connect with the customer and, if they rarely do, serve by Livvi.  They will listen to leave your store tomorrow after leaving.  Pleasure.He greeted me within 10 seconds of entering the store, asked me how my morning had been, and to take advantage of this information to create a non-sales discussion and to make me feel at ease, he addressed my needs.  Set up, listened attentively, because I am going through the feet.  And knee rehabilitation.  Then Livvy explained what your in-store technology does and I had to run up-and-down the store in bare feet, setting up my price range ( $ 170-250) and what kind of sock ( thickness) I needed to be in the neutral trainer.  I run with my orthotic before putting in, repeating the recording process of running me and then transferring me to a light-backed shoe and recording what it is  Was happy Ndu that reflect how things video.Throughout the process, he kept the technical conversation at a level that I could easily understand and follow and also keep the pace of the original non-sales conversation rolling through the process.I simply cannot praise the level of service and knowledge that I have received today.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Looters and Frauds!!! beware of flipkart,"I ordered a jaagriti shoe rack from flipkart. I have ordered multiple products from flipkart including fridge, clothes, etc. But i never imagined that returning a product to flipkart will be a nightmare. The shoe rack had very good reviews which made me order the same but to my shock when it arrived it was half torn and the quality( even if it were not torn) was that of a dishrag!!! I instantly filed a return request. Now Flipkart has designed the return request form in a way that selecting a reason for return is mandatory from a drop down menu. I selected manufacturing defect and wrote in comments as additional poor quality. The return request was accepted and a pick up date of on or before 3days later was given. Surprisingly no one showed up on the given date and no notification(text/email) came. I logged into my account to see that the seller has rejected the request. I called the customer service and the guy told that the ""seller didn't like the comments selected"". I was dumbstruck!!! And hence the seller rejected your request. The guy had nothing else to say. I was very angry but decided to re-raise the request. Similar to the previous one, i was given a date of by or before next 3 days. But yet again no one showed up. This time not even text saying ""out for pick up"". When i called customer service, may be 3 times. They told me to wait till 7pm. Post 7pm, i called again. This lady, a so called ""flipkart customer executive"" had no idea of her own organization's business policies and told me that based on the selection of my comment from the drop down menu, the seller will decide whether to pick up the product or not. She told me that I am the one who is unclear why i want to return the product. She even told me that I may go ahead and complain to the consumer forum but there is nothing that can be done!It is my request not to purchase anything from flipkart.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Flipkart continues to cheat,"There has been numerous occasion where flipkart has started cheating customers. I have experienced thrice in two years.This time I ordered a paper shredder and in return I received a Screw-Driver. I was amazed to see a paper shredder of 7 liters was packed in a half liter packet when I received the parcel. It was after unboxing I found that flipkart has again attempted.Now when I called customer care they assured that everything will be resolved in 3 days and on 3rd day I got a message ""Your issue is resolved. Your return request is cancelled. Please see Seller's return policy"".When I raised complaint after three day they again re-opened and gave me 3 days time. To my surprise on third day same thing happened. I again raised a complaint and I got 3 days and guess what - same thing continued.Now after 5th attempt I thought I should spread this message through Mouthshut to let others know what is happening while I still wait to get a resolution.I also came to know that nowadays flipkart is blocking account so that you can not return your product on time - though this has not happened to me till now.Best part is customer care telling every time ""I am Sorry to hear this, If I would have been in your position I would have felt the same"" and continuing the same thing again and again.I am planning to take this issue to legal authorities.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Pathetic customer service,"Recently I bought a pair of Lee Cooper shoes and on opening the box I found them to be a size smaller. I at once made a return request but return was denied because price tag was missing. Let me tell there was no price tag in the box or attached to the shoe when I opened the box! There was only a price and product info sticker on side of the box. I spoke to four employees of Flipkart but they made me feel like I was lying about the price tag not being there. How can I print/produce the price tag when there was none with the shoes?When I was invited to review the product and wrote my review, Flipkart did not publish it, can you believe it! They don't give a damn for the customer. Following is my review on Flipkart which they did not publish online.''Got the product on time but it was a size smaller, guess should have ordered a size bigger for this particular model!Put in a request for return, courier boy turned in and said he can't take the shoes back because the price tag is missing. I explained to him that the price tag was not there in the first place. It only had the brand tag and genuine leather logo in a plastic string on the shoe. He asked me to raise a complaint with Flipkart.I called Flipkart and told them I want to return my shoes. I was told the price tag has to be there and it was there in the box and checked by Packers before shipping. I replied I did not find any price tag in the box but there is a sticker with price, model, size and bar code on side of the shoe box. But the cs rep declined to return it and the matter was escalated to a team'.During the next few days got 3 calls from the team and they said the same thing.I understand the policy that price tag has to be there, but couldn't the seller have made a mistake and missed packing the price tag with the shoe? I got the feeling that Flipkart meant to say I am lying, that the price tag was there as stated by the seller! Ridiculous, probably the seller wants to clear inventory and comes up with such excuses to not return the product. Seller probably has a policy of once out never in!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Fraud and Cheating by Flipkart and Its seller Reta,"Hi - The seller retailnet is a fraud and cheating seller. I bought the product Samsung Fit e band for my son as birthday gift. I paid 2241 after 10% discount for the HSBC CC. The seller sent a package through Ekart ref # FMPP0452120897t on 3rd Mar 2020. However, when we opened the outer carton, we found that the inner package tamper seal was opened and the Samsung Fit e band was missing and only the charging cable and user manual only inside inner package.  We checked the outer courier carton and the outer package was fine. So, it's the seller who would have opened the tampered seal and removed the package and sent the product to cheat the buyer. We have raised the complaint with Flipkart immediately and they registered the complain as return request and immediately  in 10 mins closed  the complaint stating seller rejected the return request. I have again  raised the complaint on phone and I was told it will be investigated by concerned dept and will be addressed by 7th Mar 2020. I have not received any response till 7th March, and I contacted the Flipkart over phone and the customer care executive Mr Rohit was careless and simply told me that seller rejected the complaint and asked to send email complaint to csatflipkart.com and I got an email stating the cs email id is not in use.  Its unfortunate to note that the customer care executive mentioned that Flikart is not responsible to resolve these issue and it only facilitates buyers and sellers to deal with and they can not help buyer if seller cheats the buyer. I have been prime member and frequent buyer on Amazon for 5 years and I never faced such issue with any seller on Amazon and even if any product gets delivered with damage, Amazon customer care people resolve the problem and initiate replacement or refund. But Flipkart so pathetic and does not even want to resolve issue. This is clearcut fraud and cheating by seller through Flipkart facilitation. I would go for consumer protection but wanted to share my experience here so that other buyers will be more careful while dealing with Flipkart. My experience taught me to take video of unboxing the parcels received from these online sellers so that it would be a solid evidence when we fight in consumer court. I hope Flipkart would resolve my issue soon. Thank youFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",0,Negative

Flipkart.com,925076148,Cheating and breach of trust,"Don't ever purchase electronic items from flipkar. My brother purchased MI 8 mobile. It was mentioned that in case of any defect the mobile will be replaced within 10 days of delivery. Mobile was not working properly as motherboard had some problem as per MI service centre. He requested for replacement after 3-4 days. A person from flipkart came but refused to take back mobile. Complaint was made to flipkart, again person was sent but refused to take back the mobile, again same thing happened. Ultimately legal notice was sent. Thereafter they changed the mobile but in reply they stated they don't own any duty towards customers in view of certain clause. They are taking contradictory stand. On one hand they deal like agent of supplier, they themselves refused to take back the mobile, on the otherhand they say they are just middle man for supplying goods. Don't believe flipkart that they will support you in case of delivery of damaged goods.

An authority of the Service of Business gave this data The legislature presented new standards in February with the target of securing the interests of 13 crore individuals subject to little retailers by the alluring offers made on web based shopping. These standards constrained web based business organizations to change their business structure, despite the fact that the US condemned it. Simultaneously there was expanded pressure in the business relations among India and America.On this issue, Amazon and Flipkart were continually looking at agreeing to all the standards, while nearby business associations affirmed that the two organizations are charging colossal add up to give limits during the ebb and flow happy season. Now and again, in excess of 50 percent markdown has been given. As indicated by sources, Flipkart offers to forgo commissions to merchants offering limits on items now and again. Business Service authorities said the administration is examining the grievances and the proof gave by the Confederation of All India Dealers (CAIT), which had blamed Amazon and Flipkart for abusing outside speculation rules. CAIT speaks to 70 million retail brokers in the country.Sales of retail dealers diminished by 40 percent It is significant that last week, delegates of Amazon, Flipkart and CAIT met before the Business Service to examine this issue. CAIT general secretary Praveen Khandelwal stated, ""Because of substantial limits, clients are shopping on the web. Because of this, the offers of retailers have descended by 30 to 40 percent this month.Flipkart offered a rebate to dealers As indicated by two messages from Flipkart venders in September, the organization offered incomplete installment of limits only days before the bubbly season. As per an email, ""In the event that the dealer diminishes the cost of the item by 15%, at that point the organization will bear 9% trouble if there should be an occurrence of 3% or 30% discount.""A source related with Flipkart said that all the impetuses are under Indian principles and are proposed to urge merchants to gain by lessening the commission they pay.Unfair advantages to certain sellers! The All India Online Merchants Affiliation said in an explanation that around 100 of its individuals have exploited Flipkart's fractional discount, making undue preferred position a few venders.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Flipkart product reliability,"Many of us think that online shopping means fake products. but as per my opinion and experience while buying from flipkart specially one should select fassured product, which are 100% returnable if any defects pursued. it is very rare that flipkart products mismatched because their delivery partner have many crosschecks to deliver you the right item. the delivery partners always undergoes several criteria before delivering it. and if after that also any body getting mismatched or defect product no issue company returns it and send your hard earned money within 24 hrs but it depends on your bank some time.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Collusion of Flipkart and Jeeves in deceiving cust,"I ordered Motorola Moto E6s handset from flipkart.com, on 19-Jan-20, which was delivered to me on 20-Jan-20. As the bottom part of the phone, the display has a grey patch of around 1.5 to 2 inches, I requested for a replacement of the same on 21-Jan-20.Accordingly, a technician's visit was scheduled for 22-Jan-20. The technician Mr. Adarsh from jeeves.co.in did accept that the display was ""faulty"", however, he misinformed me regarding the procedure of return. As per him, he uploaded the pictures of the faulty display that he clicked on his phone to their portal and that I would get a status update from Flipkart within two hours of him uploading the pictures. This was the first time ever, that a technician visit was scheduled for a problem I faced. Moreover, flipkart.com had not given me any details regarding the procedure to be followed, rather the precautions to be taken while handing over the phone to the technician, hence, I believed in whatever information he provided to me.However, as soon as he stepped out of my house, notwithstanding what he told me regarding the faulty display, he cunningly and arbitrarily rejected my request for a replacement. As soon as I found out about it, I called Flipkart toll free customer care number 18008899898 and informed them about the issue at length. I also specifically complained about Mr. Adarsh, and asked their customer care executives to make a note of his name in my complaint, and take the strictest action against him for uploading fake details.Thereafter, another technician visit was scheduled which was to take place on or before 27-Jan-20. Accordingly, another technician Mr. Satish from jeeves.co.in called on 24-Jan-20 and asked to come the same day. As I was busy on that day, I asked him to come on 25-Jan-20, to which he agreed. Accordingly, I got an SMS from VKjeeves confirming that the appointment was rescheduled to 25-Jan-20 at 12:00 pm.As the technician did not visit my site till 12:00 pm on 25-Jan-20, I called back on the number +912271872225 from which he had called on 24-Jan-20. Ironically, this call was received not by Mr. Satish but by Mr. Adarsh against whom I had complained. Over the phone, he once again lied to me that my request for replacement was rejected because I had not backed up the data in my phone. If that was the case, then he should have informed me about it. I would have done a factory reset right in front of him. In my case, the phone display is faulty, in some other cases, the display could be broken or the back cover could be broken. In all these cases, is data backup a mandatory requirement? As I could no longer take his lies, I told him to send Mr. Satish for a site visit instead of him. He once again very rudely remarked that Mr. Satish is busy at the moment and will come if he gets time.On the same day i.e., on 25-Jan-20 at 17:01 hours, I got another call from +912271872225 from Mr. Pervez Ansari (not sure if it is spelled as Pervez or Parvez). According to him, Mr. Adarsh asked him to visit me instead of Mr. Satish. During our phone call, he divulged a VERY IMPORTANT & CONFIDENTIAL piece of information regarding their performance rating. As per the information provided by him, their performance is rated ""GOOD"", if they ""REJECT"" the customers' requests for replacement and vice versa. Further, he has also confessed that the genuineness or otherwise of the customers' complaints has no bearing on whether their request for replacement will be ""ACCEPTED"" or ""REJECTED"". It is purely on the basis of the ""REPORT"" provided by them.The second technician visit NEVER HAPPENED and on the morning of 26-Jan-20, I learned that my request for replacement has been rejected. During this period I spoke with several of their customer care executives. A few of them being Ashish (22-Jan-20), Vishnu (23-Jan-20), Neelam (25-Jan-20), Aditya (25-Jan-20), Sanjay (25-Jan-20), Abhishek (25-Jan-20), Paramjeet (26-Jan-20). All of them say only one thing: ""Aap nishchint rahiye. Aapki puri sahayta ki jaayegi"", without giving a damn about the customer's problems. In my opinion, as a cost-saving measure, they should just program to repeat this every 30 seconds in their IVR, instead of hiring and paying for these employees.Also, after logging into my account, going to my orders page, and selecting the appropriate order, I have raised issues several times with this product. Miraculously, all of them get resolved, without any intimation to me!!!!On searching the internet regarding jeeves.co.in, I have found that many of the directors are associated with Flipkart.From all of the above, I infer the following:1) It is very likely that the products sold on Flipkart as ""NEW"" could be ""REFURBISHED"", and hence ""DEFECTIVE"".2) Flipkart and jeeves.co.in are associated companies3) Flipkart and jeeves.co.in through their technicians COLLUDE TO CHEAT CUSTOMERS BY REJECTING THEIR GENUINE REQUESTS FOR REPLACEMENT OF FAULTY PRODUCTS4) The technicians have powers more than judges of High Courts and Supreme Court to give the one-sided report, without requiring the customers' sign-off5) The only way to get your request for replacement approved by the technician is to give them a handsome BRIBE. That is the only thing that will make them go against their employers.I want the following:1) Return pick-up of the faulty product and a full refund of Rs. 6, 499/-.2) Return pick-up and refund of the accessories bought along with the product viz., scratch guards/tempered glasses (2 units of Rs. 99/- each)3) Strict action against all the three technicians viz., Mr. Adarsh, Mr. Satish, and Mr. Pervez Ansari with intimation to me.4) Strict action against all of your above customer care executives viz., Ashish, Vishnu, Neelam, Aditya, Sanjay, Abhishek, Paramjeet.Thanks,MandarFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Pathetic exchange experience,"Hi,Got a very annoying experience with Flipkart. I ordered a Realme Xt in exchange of my iphone 6s. But my phone has screen scratch on the extreme left down corner.They messaged me if you have any phone issues you can get the phone by paying an additional amount. The amount on exchange, I was getting was 4, 500 and the amount for screen repair is hardly 1500-2000.When I went to take the delivery, the guy asked me for 4500/-, I asked it only has scratch that to very less, to this he replied this is the rule. I got really angry as when I asked in store, they were giving me an exchange of 3500 for the screen scratch, Flipkart is blindly charging. If they are taking this exchange deal, they can repair the glass for 1500 or even less, can sell this as refurbished and can still make profit out of it.Pathetic experience.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Not 100% good. Sometimes they lag.,"Most commonly I use flipkart more than any other e -commerce websites. Until now, among the products I've bought, are good. The quality seems to be worth the money. But, there are some negatives too that I want to share. I had bought a power bank for around 300 rupees and you would not believe that the delivery service took almost a month to reach me( 26 days approximately) . And, after receiving the product, it was not working on my second use. I was irritated and placed a return request and received the product by 3 days. So, totally it took one month to just deliver a power bank. And shoes at low cost are often exchanged by any other design and colour than the actually ordered one. If you can improve these little things, you are awesome. You give a variety of designs, products, discounts etc., and make our work easy. If there was 3.5 rating, that would be my option.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Don't buy anything from these thieves.... Beware!!,"This company is full of thieves and cheaters. My experience is such a tragic one I would never forgive these basstards they stole my money and did not deliver my product. I asked for a refund and they are not even ready to offer me my money back. I ordered a laptop key board skin through flipkart and initially selected the payment mode as cash on delivery(COD) but as the product reached the destination delivery center they enabled the option of payment through the Debit / Credit card or any other payment system available. Now I made the payment of the product through the debit card on the day of delivery as I was short of exact change and it got debited successfully from my bank account. But after the payment was done the flipkart app started displaying me message saying that ""Payment was successful. But we are awaiting confirmation from our courier partner"". I don't understand what the hell they have to confirm from the courier partner as I have made the payment using their mobile app and not their courier partners. The worst thing happened when their courier agent came to deliver the product I told that ashhole that I have already made the payment to Flipkart for the product and even showed him all the messages that I received from Bank and Flipkart instead he started demanding cash from me for the product when I denied paying him for the second time he started speaking to me very arrogantly and simply went back without handing me the product. Now, when I spoke to the Flipkart agent they started saying that the payment I made to them is successfully displayed in their system but we still need confirmation from the courier team and it's almost more than a week now and still my problem is unresolved everyday I spend hours and hours talking to these ashholes yet they spit out the same story that I see in their mobile app. I humbly urge all indians who believe the trauma that I going through here and request everyone to  strictly ban such an unworthy company who steal peoples money and do not give them their products nor refund their money that the customer paid to purchase the product. My brother faced a similar such incident with Flipkart for Rs.2200 product that he purchased and it is 3 years now that he hadn't received the refund from this company mine is still a cheaper amount when compared to my brother.

My mother requested him by explaining that the battery might be dead and if he can w8 he can see that the phone is working fine. He left and said he'll return in 15mins.He came back and I was there seeing him scraping the phone for 15mins to find any scratch or cut and said if you want the mobile pay the total amount or it will be his loss as he has to take the phone back to the company because of the policy. The mobile was in good condition and bearing no cuts or scratches worth denying the exchange.He left, and even after complaining about the incident to the help center none of the issues were getting resolved. I shared the pictures of my phone with them and without any comment validating any problem with my device they just denied my request claiming it to be company policy.The phone was out of stock the next moment, but I was able to do a successful transaction after some time on the official realme website with the mobile exchange.I've done several online transactions on Amazon even the mobile exchange ones, sometimes the cost might be a little bit more when compared to Flipkart, but I never faced any bad service or unjust treatment from amazon.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

I have made several purchase on flipkart and I was always satisfied with overall process of purchase.I love the UI and UX of flipkart in my opinion flipkart's UI and UX on website and App is best in the world.They offer great discount time to time but you need to be careful as sometimes they change the price to offer discount. For example a product being sold for MRP 500Rs. will be sold for 490/- but they will show you MRP of the product as 700/- Rs. that way they play psychological game with you.I know most ecommerce use this strategy but user should be aware about this.Their shipping is very fast most of the time they deliver before expected delivery date.Overall you can trust FlipkartFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,WARNING: THIS COMMODE CHAIR CAN BE HAZARDOUS,"On 09 December 2019, I received delivery of the Orthtex commode chair I had ordered from Flipkart.I found so many flawed aspects in the piece that I received that I wrote the review(below), and tried several times to get it put out on the Flipkart review section online, along with the 1-star rating I had given it. Each time I submitted the review, I received a message saying: âThank you so much. Your review has been saved.âThere was no follow-up message from Flipkart to explain to me, as the buyer and reviewer, what this cryptic message meant, or why my review wasnât being published online for other potential customers to read. Did it exceed any word limit set for reviews?(No such word limit has been mentioned on the product page).Since I did not receive the courtesy of a response, or the opportunity to share my experience with others, I reproduce my review, below. I also intend putting it out on other suitable websites online in the interest of disseminating useful product information to consumers.(The seller of this product is Cousins Corporation, based in Ahmedabad).THE REVIEW:On opening the package itself, I found a loose screw that was just lying in one corner of the wrapping. On checking the stool, I found that one of the front legs was missing a screw, and that the loose screw was the missing one, since it matched the corresponding screw in the opposite leg.An attempt was made to fit the screw back in place, but it did not go in all the way, probably because the screw is in some way damaged(worn-out threads?). Because of this flaw, the back legs of the stool remain wobbly and unstable, which poses an obvious risk. I have not yet started using the stool, fearing that one or more legs may give way at any point.  Is this the level of quality that an orthopaedic seat should possess? It is meant to aid and assist, not to cause discomfort and anxiety.And this is not all. The stool legs were smelling of very fresh paint, even from a distance. This could have meant that the stool was a brand-new piece that had been painted just before being shipped to me â but I doubt that this is the explanation because the seat itself had graze marks in several places. It became clear to me that this is a âre-conditionedâ piece, and probably one that has been returned by another dissatisfied buyer.I had read previous complaints on this web page about this stoolâs screws coming off, and now I wish I had paid more heed to those complaints, instead of thinking it had happened to only a few people, and not expecting it to happen to me.I will add that there is a discrepancy between the product description and the product itself. On the Flipkart web page, the product is described as being â(grey, black)â in colour. The label on the packaged product, as well as the Tax Invoice, also falsely describe the colour as âgreyâ. But the colour of the stool is actually a shade of Midnight Blue. This may seem like just a matter of appearance, and unimportant in this kind of product. But the fact that the colour is consistently and falsely described as âgreyâ or âGrey / Blackâ by the seller and the e-commerce company speak of a lack of integrity and a shoulder-shrugging disrespect for the customer. This point(about the seat in the delivered product being a different colour from that displayed online by Flipkart) has also been mentioned in other product reviews of this commode chair(on the Flipkart web page).I have considered returning the product which remains unused, but Flipkartâs 10-days replacement policy is cleverly designed to favour itself and not the aggrieved customer. I will mention just two clauses in this policy which work against the customer:âThe product should be in unused, undamaged and original condition without any scratches or dentsâ.But how does one return a product without scratches when the seat(as I mentioned above) arrives at the customerâs door with grazes in several places? How is it okay for a product to be delivered in damaged condition, when it is not okay for it to be returned for replacement in damaged condition? Do no responsibility and culpability rest with the manufacturer and seller for making and selling a product in damaged condition?âThe productâs original packaging / box should be undamagedâ.But the commode stool did not come in a box of its own(which, by the way, also leaves a poor impression). It came in a corrugated cardboard packaging, wrapped so tightly around the stool that it was impossible to open it up without cutting and tearing through the packaging(although the label itself remains intact, bearing all details).But my greatest hesitation about opting for a replacement is that I may well get a piece that is in even worse condition than the present one!A commode stool is an aid used by people facing a certain level of physical difficulty â because they are elderly, ailing, have disability, are recovering from a Caesarean, etc. It is shameful and contemptible that the manufacturers should treat such a group of people with so little consideration that they try to dump sub-standard products on them. Is the profit margin all that matters?I believe Flipkart also has a responsibility in the matter. When there are several complaints about something as basic as badly-fitted screws, and as important as stable legs in an orthopaedic aid, should Flipkart be giving a platform to such manufacturers, in the bargain compromising its own reputation?I will be sharing my above experience on consumer websites. Consumers deserve a better deal than this kind of shoddy approach.IMPORTANT POSTSCRIPT:  I need to add a postscript to my review in view of what happened when I did try to use the chair for the first time(three days ago, on 27 December 2019).I had barely sat down on the chair for a couple of minutes when it collapsed, the back legs simply folding up. It is a folding chair, but is not supposed to fold spontaneously when you are sitting upon it; and I had definitely taken care to make sure the legs had been stretched open to max before sitting on it.I fell backward, hitting my head against the wall, with my legs entangled in the legs of the chair. I felt an excruciating pain in my left hip(which is already affected by arthritis),   and was in such a state of shock that I did not even know whether I would be able to get up. I was alone in my flat at the time, and could not call for help. It was several minutes before I managed to push the stool off me and literally crawl out of the bathroom.I need to add that what occurred had nothing to do with overweight. I weigh only 52 kg. My hip is still in severe pain(despite the use of pain-killers),   and my mobility is restricted because of the pain.Before buying this product, I had checked out the customer reviews and found that most of them were positive. But I now wish I had paid more heed to the fewer but very precise negative comments which included the following:âI just literally fell down, sitting on itâ¦ bolts are loose ââThe back legs of the commode fold by itself, and the commode will fully fold suddenly while sitting and person sitting can break waist, hips, legs or hands.ââWhen you sit down on a chair, its bases are assembled and person will be fall downâ¦ very bad.ââThe chairâs legs are oddly shaped and unstable. My aged mom fell down numerous times. Wish to return thisâ¦ââChair legs not sturdyâ.âLeg rod bent in just 15 daysâThere were several other complaints on these lines, and others relating to scratches on the seat âlike a used oneâ; plastic quality of the seat âvery badâ; loose screws and worn-out threads; product colour different from what is shown online.But, what made me decide to buy the product is the fact that the positive reviews greatly outnumbered  the negative ones, using descriptions such as âJust wow!â, âMind-blowing purchaseâ, âWonderfulâ, âHighly recommendedâ, âTerrificâ, âAwesomeâ, âFabulous!â etc, etc â¦ But, on the basis of my personal experience, I have to wonder how many of these positive reviews are authentic. In my mind, now, there will always remain a question mark over that.Of course, there is no question of my ever using this chair again; it is just too risky.But, at the least, I hope that my experience will sound an alarm bell to others who may be thinking of buying the product. You do so at your own risk.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",0,Negative

At the same time the  shelves started changing it's shape unable to bare weight of clothes stored on it.  Now since August 2019 I have started complaining. They started responding after November. Called and informed me that it will not be replaced but taken back and refund will be issued. Email  was Sent of confirming the same.  But Flipkart confirms and their business partners  Jeeves  are playing tricks and avoiding the same. This is happening since last ten days regularly every day both are harrasing me by making different statements and not doing the action promised to me.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Won't recommend.,"I have heard from many that flipkart is fooling people by showing wrong reviews, ratings. So I tried to verify and that came out to be true. Out of total good reviews which you sees on flipkart more than half are fake. The reviewers are paid to write good about their products. And also if you write anything wrong about their products or site then they will delete it by giving reason that they solicit only  product specific reviews on the product page and hence your review on our service has been removed. Inshort they are scared of negative review and just want to maintain their reputation and image. Now coming to quality of their product the product which they displays is totally different from what you recieves. If you are lucky then only you will get the product of right quality. Their delivery time is okay. They delivers on the expected date but sometimes the delivery can also get delayed due to some reason. Overall I will suggest not to rely on flipkart reviews only. Go through each and everything about the product on various sources like youtube , google and many other sites and then only decide whether to buy or not.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Flipkart is a big fraud company,"I ordered Realme XT(6GB RAM, Pearl white) on 1st October during big billion day by exchanging my old Lenovo K3 note and I received the product on 4th October. But they sent me Realme XT(4GB RAM, Pearl blue). I repeatedly made request by calling the customer support and through emails to either replace or refund the product but your representative didn't take the matter seriously. They keep on increasing the timeline upto 1 month and after that, they confidently said that the product can't be replaced or refund. Because of the ignorance of the seller, even after the availability of the product in the store the replacement is rejected. During this whole month, I feel that Flipkart intentionally support the seller instead of taking any legal action.to hide their fault, the seller intentionally kept the request on hold so that the customer could not get the replacement or refund. The customer support even processed the wrong reason due to which the request got canceled and I had to suffer by losing my money. Now they refuse to take any request to resolve the issue. In reality, there is no return option in Flipkart it's just a trap to loot the customers. They will trap you in the cycle of replacement or refund and harass until you gave up. In this way they make money.  Amazon is far more better than Flipkart. If you want harassment then go for Flipkart and if you want peace choose other.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Misleading offers,"Festival offer of 10% discount for purchases on SBI cards was shown on the home page.  When I started to explore further it showed that minimum purchase should be Rs.3000/-  It has not shown that it will be available on purchase of specific products. I made a selection of grocessory and kitchenware items and about to checkout. When it has not shown any discount I contacted Customer Care. I specifically enquired whether the items selected by me are entitled for discount.  He has gone through the list of items selected and confirmed  that I am entitled to get the discount. When I told him that discount is not reflecting, he told me to go ahead with purchase and claim for the discount by raising an issue and it would be refunded.  Accordingly I have gone ahead and made the payment.  When I raised an issue some one from flipcart contacted and clarified that the discount is not extended to the items purchased by me. I reiterated that I made the purchase only after having it confirmed by the customer executive now how they can say that I would not be entitled.Thereafter I received another call stating there was no offer on SBI Card. I rejected their explanation. I received another call third time and was told that I made a purchase of around Rs.1800 and hence not eligible.  When I told them about the purchase of grocery items in the same order they verified and came back confirming the purchase o Rs.3086/-. After a few minutes they came up with a plea that one item purchased by me for Rs.100/- is not eligible hence the purchase has come down to 2986/- falling Rs.3000/- hence I am not eligible.  When I raised a question that why your customer has not informed me when he has gone through the entire list of items I have selected they could not says anything except apologising for the inconvenience. In order to make my purchase Rs.3000/- and above, I have purchased certain of the items which I actually do not require.It appears they are trying to find one reason or other in order to establish that I am not entitled for the discount.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Dubious sellers are banking on flipkart's loophole,"Hi folks!Here's an online shopping experience which left me with a bitter taste. This is regarding a purchase I made in the just concluded Flipkart's Diwali festival sale period. This scenario is not limited to just sale period though. It can happen even otherwise but the sale period seems to be the most conducive period for unscrupulous sellers for disposing off their defective merchandise. Because the benefits like cash-backs offered during these period serve as ""sweet bait"" and ""too hard"" to resist!To begin with, I was looking for a particular model of a voltage stabilizer ""VGuard VGX 400"" which I couldn't find anywhere else other than Flipkart. Otherwise my first choice would be Amazon.Luckily on Flipkart, I found four of its listings. But the confusing part about these listings was that each of them were posted by the SAME seller who goes by the title ""DKFOREVER"". All four of them were of the exact SAME model and SAME color with no mention of their individual status which causes me to assume that they must all be ""NEW"". However, two of them were assured by Flipkart and two were not. The assured ones were priced considerably higher compared to their non-assured counterparts. Another difference I noticed was that each of them were listed with a slightly modified title heading, which I believe may be an attempt by seller to make it appear that they are from different sellers!Why would a seller do that? I tried to contact the seller but unfortunately Flipkart doesn't have such provision in place. This has even been confirmed by Flipkart's senior customer service managers. Keep this in mind:FLIPKART DOESN'T HAVE A PROVISION FOR A BUYER TO CONTACT SELLER!Now, here's the catch. At a first glance for someone who's looking at the product's listing, it gives an impression that all four of them could be from different sellers! And as the human nature has it, we tend to pick the cheapest one just as I did. The reason I did that is because I thought even if I had ordered higher priced ones, I may end up getting the same product regardless because the seller is same across all four listings!But right from the point I clicked ""Buy"", I have been doubting that there must be something not-so-right with the low priced ones like they might have been damaged / refurbished / used / returned or something like that.Not-for nothing! As suspected, the item I received turned out to be a defective and a used one. There were signs of physical damage on the metal casing - the rear of the metal chassis was recessed slightly into the frame and the corner was clearly seen to be dented. Even the power cord was chipped a little to make it appear that it was an UNUSED one. All these tell tale signs suggest that the product was a used one and that it either must have suffered a severe fall or got pounded badly. This for me, is not acceptable. I immediately requested a replacement.The story doesn't end here. The item was rescheduled for pickup four times! Every time, the pickup was scheduled, the pick up person would cite some inappropriate reason like ""mismatch"" and by doing so, it would render the replacement request cancelled. No wonder why Flipkart calls them ""wish-masters""! Everything happens at their whim and wish! This pickup guy whose name is ""KRANTHI"" was somewhat reckless in his attitude. The first time he came to my place, he told me that he could not accommodate the item in his vehicle. At other times, he skipped the pickup altogether without a reason and would close the process citing the aforementioned reason! I raised complaints against him with Flipkart. I don't know if they ever bother to take action against him.What this implies is that if you don't notice this on time and don't take any action during the stipulated 10-day return period, like re-initiating the replacement / refund request, the status stands cancelled and you get to keep the item with you.My question is who on earth authorized a pickup guy to cancel the replacement request without actually visiting the premises where the pickup is scheduled? This is clearly a loophole in the logistics operations. No online retailer should allow this to happen. Ultimately it is the customer who will lose.After speaking to numerous executives and some senior ones, at last, I was told that the seller did not have another piece for replacement and that I didn't have any option but to seek refund. At the behest of the senior executive who passed on this information, I sought refund.But what happened in the end? I lost out on other potential purchases which could have offered me equally impressive discounts. When I raised this point with senior managers, they said that they couldn't help it as the Diwali festival offer had already concluded.So, to summarize, I was trying in vain to get a replacement for over a week all to hear that the replacement wasn't possible and lost out on the 10% cashback had I bought a similar item elsewhere.Folks, enough of these festival offers. In reality, there are NO FREE LUNCHES and THERE CANNOT BE SOMETHING FOR NOTHING or SOMETHING THAT IS CHEAP AND BEST.Even I had availed better offers in the past but the pricing was reasonable. This is not for the first time I'm shopping from Flipkart either. I've been purchasing items online since 2007. A good many of them were also from China, Singapore & US. I've also imported items by paying duties. I'm telling you all this to establish that I'm not new to online purchases.Next time when you spot a listing with unusually low price, suspect that it could be defective.So, Flipkart has become a conducive platform for dubious sellers especially during the festival sales period. I urge customers not to be penny wise and pound foolish; we safeguard and count pennies while pounds slip away from pockets - just like that! Be a cautious buyer.PS: I even intimated a senior customer service manager from Flipkart in my last communication with him/her that I would be posting this review on mouthshut.com.Thank you all,Regards,Hemanth.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

According to discussion with them I have shared old mobile images to them and they validated my mobile looking at attached images .flipkart customer support replied saying my mobile is damaged, not functional and you cannot avail this service and this order is cancelled. Seriously I was like how come they can examine functional behavior and clouding part by looking at those images without checking product in real.They never call back and update customer, directly sends email with new guidelines and mentions that your order has been cancelled and make a new order and we hope your issue is resolved.when I called back and asked flipkart representatives to check exchange offer guidelines which are different from received email guidelines then their representative does not know where these exchange offer guidelines are mentioned in site and all of a sudden they changed words like seller rejected your old mobile under exchange offer you can send feedback on this blah blah.and read the same lines of received email.In this case flipkart and merchant played with customer valuable time which is more than anything and  in this case how should customer feel after making more than 50 CALLS . flipkart customer support guys never understood the problem as they dont even know where terms and conditions are mentioned under exchange offer.I request every customer to think twice before purchasing big amount product. as flipkart not worried about valuable customers and their satisfaction only hunger about selling products.Being a regular customer of flipkart I highly regretful for choosing this site for purchasing.mobile as I should have got it within one day being prime member in amazon.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Worst Business ethics,"I purchased a mobile from Flipkart, their invoice shows 11797/- but in no-cost EMIs I pay in total is 12249/-When asked why the Invoice does not show the total cost of the mobile which is 12249 and why they don't show total payment I am incurring on the purchase of mobile in the invoice, none of their support team has right answers, they say invoice contains payment to be made to the seller not the device cost. Which is the most dangerous answer I could hear and they simply close the ticket without even contacting you!This way, Flipkart is unworthy and unreliable as their Invoice does not contain device cost in total and giving the perception of cheap compared to other sites.Be watchful on their bogus invoice system.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Flipkart is cheating their Customers,"Have ordered a product on 8th Oct 2019.

I am sorry for the thing happened to you. they will not give any resolution for your issue.They were telling you product will be delivery for sure, as soon as possible.  They are sure about when it will be delivered.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Buyback gurantee offer,"WORST ONLINE SHOPPING APP! I bought OPPO K1 in february with buyback gurantee and on 30th september I placed the order for OPPO F11 PRO in exchange with oppo k1 through the buyback gurantee. The delivery boy came nd said there is no pickup , he asked for 20400 for the mobile. Also, I would like to tell that it was written on the site that if my pickup was rejected I had to pay 17000 something amount. He asked for 3000 something more amount.Then my mother called me . when I showed him the sms of pickup he changed his statement and said your mobile can't be exchanged without any reason and said me to cancel my order. After stepping out he called to show flipcart that its not his fault and asked me have you cancelled your order? I replied no! He cut the call and left . I am very disappointed. The date was 10th october. I tried the whole day to put a complaint but their ""write to us""option was not working. At night I called and then complained . They say ""apki poori sahayta ki jayegi""but they don't call don't solve the problem. Today's the last day of buyback gurantee so I called them again they said to place the order again. I tried and now their site isn't working! I literally called them 7 times and no solution. They have forwarded the message . this is all they know. I am very disappointed.

Flipkart.com,925076148,The Fake Phone Exchange Program,"Order ID-OD116671577527415000I ordered a Redmi note 7 Pro in the Big billion sale on 30th September with 11th oct as the delivery date for the product. I've put my old phone, Moto G4 Play on exchange and so during the last couple of days when I got the message that my order has reached the nearest hub, I got the backup from my phone and reset it as per the instructions to keep it ready for the exchange.The delivery guy came on 11th and asked for the phone first which needed to be exchanged. The phone was in working condition with no dents or any other issues mentioned in the exchange program. The delivery guy switched on the phone, checked all the aspects and then told me that an additional 600 shall be charged for one of the dents at the bottom. There were no dents on the phone  and I very well pointed that out but he said that he had sent the pictures and he was getting the increased cost. When I checked the increased cost, there was no information of the source from where the additional cost was coming and neither did I receive any message for the same. After much haggle, however, I agreed as I was in dire need of the product since I had been managing without one from a couple of days.When I prepared to give him cash, I asked him for the product but he promptly rejected stating that I need to give the cash first. This had never happened before and it made me cautious. I told him that if he cannot handover the product then he should at least open it for me so that I can check the order to confirm it is the one I placed or to be more precise, there is actually a phone inside. He refused that too saying that if a phone is not in the packet then I can ask for the refund later and I shall get my money back. I requested him a couple of times saying that I have money in hand and I'm not going to run away with it as I'm standing at my doorstep and there is no way I'm not paying if a phone is inside the packet but he said that I can go to the warehouse myself to collect the order but he will not give it without the total initial plus the additional cost. I was kept in a situation where I should give 10, 000 rs with no confirmation message of the increased cost and no guarantee of the product. This is when I asked him to leave and took my old phone back.I raised an issue with the Flipkart team and had conversations with four of the customer service executives, all telling me that there is nothing that they can do until the order status is updated by the delivery company. I got in touch with the delivery company as well but they had no clue about it either. I've never  experienced such discomfort with online shopping in my life and when I searched about it on internet I got to know that I'm not the only one. A lot of people on a daily basis face the same kind of unprofessional behavior from Flipkart and this is the worst site to buy anything that costs you more than 500 bucks.

The wishmaster came for the delivery and upon checking my old phone said there is a problem with the touch on the screen and phone cant be exchanged and need to pay the balance in cash to take the delivery.On bringing to his notice that as per Flipkarts exchange policy even if there is an issue with the product that needs to be exchanged, it can still be done after paying the lesser exchange value(in this case Rs.2000 as the touch not working). He said will check with his manager after going to the office and will come back to do the delivery next day.We waited for the entire day taking an off from work so the delivery can be taken but he never came nor there was any contact with him.So I called Flipkart helpline on 4th evening to check on the order delivery and was assured the Team is working on it and will be resolved by 9th Oct 2019 at the Max.Today I received a message that the order is cancelled that too without my knowledge or approval.On contacting the contact center again, where Swati(frontline) had communication issues and said to reorder as she cant change the status of the current order and there is no way she can raise a dispute / complaint.Why would I want to reorder the same product at a higher price?I was then connected to Shubham on the escalation desk but he too said cant help.So I asked for a manager and Priti came on line(I highly doubt she was a manager as she was worst than Swati in communication) and ACCEPTED that the issue was from Flipkart and there is a flaw in the system. If you already know there is a flaw then you need to work on resolving the issue to have abetter customer experience.I am now writing this for sheer bad customer experience rendered upon me starting from the Wishmaster to contact center staff.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Why Flipkart Standards are Spiraling down??,"Last week we had ordered a Mobile from Flipkart.com(Order No: OD116213834846926000)What we received was a used and defective mobile phone(having Network issues and with torn internal package and without Instruction manuals.) Just think - did you ever received a mobile phone package without Instruction manuals, and everything torn out internally? Initially, they rejected our Return/Refund request. But, after much persuasion we were able to return it and get refund for the product.I was a big fan of Flipkart and had ordered many Products from them, and this was the dirtiest experience faced by us. And amazingly, when we complained about our mobile phone issue to Flipkart, they immediately removed the Seller(called:  ""Rinku Deal""), from our Order details. Probably they thought that we would give a negative feedback for the Seller.Another problem of these companies is their customer service, and their availability and knowledge. Its extremely hard to reach them as everybody now-a-days are automating the entire process to save money.Probably these companies should be avoided by us in the near future. I have learned my lesson the hard way, and probably its better to go personally to the Electronics store and buy our products. At least we know what we are buying.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",0,Negative
Flipkart.com,925076148,New laptop not working,Horrible customer service by flipkart . I ordered a ASUS laptop within 13 days itself the laptop sound stopped working . Now they are not taking responsibility of it . They deliver u defective pieces which will work 11 to 45 days that's why they have kept 10 days return policy as they know very well the defective pieces which they deliver will work fine for 10 days . Later theyjust say we are very sorry we can't do anything as the return period is over . But atleast they can arrange a technician who comes & looks into what exactly the issue is . They just give you tempting offers & sell all the defective products .Better buy from Amazon .

Flipkart.com,925076148,Worst company,"We don't do what we say.  This should be the punch line of this company. I booked Samsung 4K TV in flipkart, thinking let me go with Indian company rather than American Amazon, although both websites listed same price for the product. But I am repenting my decision. Never faced such issue with amazon ever. They take each customer complain so seriously. And here in Flipkart I have called their CC for 7 times since last 24 hours, and no one is able to give me exact information about the delay of my delivery.  They dont even know who is the courier company or guy dealing with my order. They patched up with GATI courier company, and everyone know how fraud and cheap courier company they are, they will never come to your house but will update in their website as customer is not available at home. Flipkart will go down if they dont improve their CC department and stop forming partnership with cheap courier companies.

It was a 'fully paid order' and not 'cash on delivery'. But they had neither delivered it on that date, nor on the extended dates (19th & 21st). They raised a false aligation that they couldn't able at contact me over phone on all these three days. The aligation is not true since I was beside my mobile phone on all these three days and hadn't found any misscall alert. Now Flipkart has cancelled the order one sided. Today, Flipkart's Customer Support Representative informed us that the printer got damaged by the delivery boy of the courier (I recorded the conversation and kept the screenshot of all the communications) and requested me once again to sent a fresh order for which I need to pay more than Rs 1000 extra.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Fake Products,"Fake baby products being sold on Flipkart and when the issue is highlighted Flipkart washes off its hands and  refuses to accept that the product is fake and spends a lot of time convincing to me that the product is original.Without even taking back the product from me to verify my claim they indirectly have been pointing out that they only side with the vendor as he is verified by them and I am wrong in my claim because they trust their vendor. I am using the same product since 11 months for my baby and never faced any issue until I bought it from Flipkart.They even went to the heights to tell me that the vendor has provided me with a invoice so product is not fake.  When I reminded them that the invoice is from Flipkart and not the Brand / Original Manufacturing Company and if they consider the  product to be original just because they have provide me with an invoice then they should provide me with an invoice from the brand itself and immediately it can be proved whether the product is genuine or not . They did not have an answer.The end result it that they are unwilling to pick up the product to verify my claim, unwilling to take it up with the vendor hence proving that they are OK with vendors  selling fake products.Anyways I have stopped purchasing from Flipkart and so have most people in my social circle.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Flipkart.com,925076148,Cheating by Flipkart,"Absolute cheating by Flipkart in the name of exchange offer! I had ordered a mobile on exchange offer on 7th August(Order no OD116205018856077000). They had promised to pay an additional Rs. 2k on exchange(total of 4950) for my moto g5 plus. But the Executive who came to deliver the mobile on 9th simply refused to exchange stating that there was colour change in the side of display. When we tried to convince him that it was only due to the tempered glass which we had just then removed, he just said that he could not accept as his team leader would not accept the same. He then asked for 4, 850 in cash to deliver the mobile which we refused. When I complained about the same to Flipkart, they apologised for the error and assured that they would exchange my mobile and deliver the new one by 11th august and that I would receive a call from the technical team by 11th. But I have not received any call from them and today evening, I received another message stating that the technical team would call me by 12th august with no promise about delivery date. Incidentally, the same executive came to my house today night to deliver another item in my order and on my prompting him why he didn't accept my mobile, he stated that his team leader had told him in advance not to accept the mobile!After I posted about the issue in Social Media on 12th August, I received a call from the Social Media Team on the same day who promised to resolve the issue within 24-48 hours, and asked for detailed photographs of each part of the phone. I sent everything within 10 minutes, but the same day in teh night, I receive a mail from Flipkart stating that my order has been cancelled and the amount would be refunded.  When I mentioned the same to the Social Media Team(Mr.Nishant) the next day, he assured that they are still working on the complaint and assured that there would be a resolution as the amount is yet to be refunded.  But yesterday the same person contacts me again and says that as the order has been cancelled and amount already refunded, I have to place a fresh order and they would assure that the item would be exchanged and new phone delivered.  When I asked him whether I would get the same offers as I received for the previous phone, he said that it would not be possible.So it is now very very clear that their only intention was to lure customers into buying with additional exchange offers and then reject exchange and then force them to buy at a higher price. Really upset with this company which was once a true Indian company with high ethics.  Was continuing with my complaint that I would atleast get some resolution after repeated complaints, but now it is very clear that this was a planned cheating by your website right from teh beginning.So this is the way Flipkart cheats their customers in the name of additional exchange offer - lure customers first with exchange offers and then reject exchange for flimsy reasons and force the Customer to pay extra and take the mobile!Absolutely disgusted with this cheating by FlipkartRithesh Kumar JainFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Then the installation was promised by Saturday 10th August.I contacted flipkart cust care, 1800 208 9898, on 10th August 12:59 PM, to inform them about the updated number the installation guys should contact me on. The guy said me to wait till evening, the appointment has been booked at 6 pm and then contact again tomorrow if no one shows up. I sure waited till evening postponing my plans to see if anyone comes home to install the TV. But sure enough no body shows up.I then get the call from Flipkart at 1:08 PM on 11th August. He said to me that he has placed a request for address change(cause he can not just change phone number, he has to request address change to change the phone number) and promised me that the installation will be done by 12th August. I waited at my home for installation guys to come home whole day on 12th August. NOBODY SHOWS UP. No call even on my updated number.Now already loosing my patience, I call Flipkart cust care on 1800 208 9898 at 9:45 AM 13th August. She was not helpful at all. She said she was sorry and she is raising complaint and said that it will be resolved by 16th August. Furious, I denied to wait till then and wanted to get in contact with someone local. She denied that she can not give any number. However she did give me jeeves cust service number 1800 425 365 365. I called jeeves number but it was not helpful at all as it was phone mobile phones.I then looked up flipkart jeeves online and got the number 1800 4252 5252. I spoke to a lady and she said that the system says the customer is not ready. Surprised I asked why would it say that. I was ready waiting for the installation whole day yesterday and no body showed up. She also said that my new updated number is in the system and she is escalating the issue. And promised me that the installation will be done today by 7 pm. And technician will contact me within 3 hours.I get the call from flipkart(not the technician) at 13th August 12:19PM to let me know that the installation will be done today by 7 pm.I waited till more than 3 hours but didn't receive any call from technician. So I again call 1800 4252 5252 at 4:54PM 13th August and spoke with lady. She informed me that the technician has been assigned and he will install it by today 7pm. And that I can contact him on his number. I hung up the phone and called him immediately at 5:00 pm 13th August. He mentioned that he tried calling me yesterday 12th August but didn't get answer so we don't come. It is their policy to not visit customer house if they don't receive phone call. And he continued that it is 5 pm which is late now and there is no person available to perform installation today. I said I was promised to have installation done today by flipkart. And he said he can not come.I immediately call the 1800 4252 5252 number at 5:11. Spoke with guy and said that I have the technician number. I said I spoke to him and said he cant come. But I cant wait and has to have this installation done which was 3 days overdue. He said that he has escalated the issue and there will be an alternative technician allocated for installation. I should not worry and sure enough that the installation will be done today.I waited an hour and call the 1800 4252 5252 at 6:17 to get update on installation and alternative technician person. The person repeated same tale and said that he has escalated the issue and the installation will be done by end of the day today.Waited 45 minutes and called 1800 4252 5252 again at 7:04 pm and said it is past 7 pm and no body has showed up for installation. He said installation will be done by the end of the day. however is was already end of the day. He said he is escalating issue and I said the issue has been escalated twice and nothing has been done. He said that installation will be done today. However the technician is not responding. I asked if technician is not responding then how will the installation be done today. He then proceeds to tell me that he is escalating to branch manager. He spoke to branch manager and has given my details to him also told me that branch manager will be contacting me within 15 minutes.I sure waited 20 minutes and no body calls me. I called 1800 4252 5252 number again and repeated my issue and said that I want installation done today. Now they are saying that the branch is closed and installation will be done tomorrow.

Flipkart.com,925076148,Worst electronic Product and Service,Today will first time I will be giving feedback for Flipkart products. Hop many would echo with my feedback.Completely Dissatisfied Flipkart -  This is not happening for the first time. A product(Nokia 5.1 Plus) which I  bought 8 months back was defective. With too much unnecessary argument your executive made  for replacement of defective phone. And finally another replaced phone came with different issue in it. Though  I raised concerned with it but was in-vain. And now I ordered a new phone(Realme 3 Pro) in exchange. And now flipkart executive says your phone is defective. It is bended(1st Executive) but this does not ends here he called another engineer to check who came up with another thesis i.e. While pressing on screen the color changes. How can the phone be working fine with such issue. If you all don't want to exchange why you put up and dude what you all are doing. And just FYI today I got it replaced with one your competitor who did not even asked any question and for him everything was working fine. Are you really into serious business? I guess I will stop purchasing electronic items from you all and definitely this should be brought to other people notice so that they feel cheated.

Flipkart.com,925076148,@Flipkart and @ThomsonTvIndia deadly combination,"I purchased Thomson LED TV from Flipkart on 17th June 2019 and at the installation was done on 21st June 2019. During the installation time itself Jeeves engineer noticed manufacturing defect on TV with the Optical Audio Output port, and took photo and assured me TV will be replaced. Then the next day I got a call from Flipkart Customer support regarding the purchase, and I told them about the issue and they noted it and told me that TV will be replaced as its a Manufacturing defect.Then got call from Jeeves and they scheduled a technician visit at my place to take photo and video of the defect so that they can proceed with replacement. I received calls and messages continously from Jeeves regarding this and on every call I was assured that they are working on the replacement and 5 seperate engineers visited my home to take photo and videos telling that its part of their replacement process and everytime I was assured that replacement will be done soon.On July 4th morning I received call from Jeeves customer service and told me to initiate a replacement with Flipkart. Flipkart customer service told that the 10 day replacement period was over and it cannot be replaced, and they were unaware of any complaint from my end.The service engineer who came for installation is from Jeeves( Flipkart subsidiary), and he knew it on the first day itself and told me that he will report to flipkart regarding this and I dont have to do anything from my part. Also I have informed this issue with the Flipkart customer support the very next day after installation.For the last months I have been receiving calls and messages from Flipkart and Jeeves and 5 engineers visited my place and took photos and videos, telling that it's needed for replacement and nothing happened.

Flipkart.com,925076148,This is the most irritating website!!!,"In the year 2013 I had ordered a shoe from Yepme company that was supposed be green in color and when I purchased it from flipkart using the Cash On Delivery method( COD) , I received this shoe with smaller size than what was required, I immediately contacted the customer care and they weren't replying and later when they replied, trust me these were the most misbehaved people who couldn't help at all and were constantly shouting.It seemed like they wanted to scare away the customer who wanted to return the purchase and get a refund.Later after speaking to their seniors, they sent a man at my house who collected the shoe and went away, after fighting with them for several months, they sent a cheque that couldn't be deposited as it got bounced.Later they called me up and said that they have abolished their policy of returning the money by cheque and they only return it by bank tranfer. Now it has been more than 5 years, nor has money been returned through bank transfer neither by cheque or kind. Honestly I hate Flipkart and I am never going to shop anything from this website again and nor will I suggest anyone to do so.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

The display has some white spots which is quite common foran old TV and why will the customer then opt for exchange as other items ofthe TV are functional at its best state. This is just a hype which yourcompany has created in exchange. The TV is in working condition at its bestas its a branded LG Led TV. The courier boy refused the LG TV and the orderstands as cancelled. Not an issue, for me just delete my flipkart accountas this was the last order from flipkart. I will strongly raise this issuein Consumer Forum and I went through the terms and conditions as I am alawyer and I will raise this issue that why the customer will exchange anitem in return for a new product. Leaving the Display are the other itemsof the TV useful or not covered under Working State? The display has spotsbut functional with clear picture and sound. Resolution demanded: 1. DeleteMy flipkart account. 2. If the new TV is not given please delete allcustomer credentials immediately. My Led TV of LG brand is being exchanged at a price of Rs10000 which was bought at Rs 44000. Doesn't this means a depreciation of the TV.

Flipkart.com,925076148,"Cheater, Liars and Pathetic Service Providers","I ordered a King size bed on 17th June 2019. The product got delivered with open packaging from both sides on 20th June 2019. The Installation of the same was done on 21st June 2019. After installation when we checked the bed it was broken from 2 sides. I immediately reported that to Flipkart on 22nd of June 2019. They said a technician will visit and we will pick the order and issue a refund for the same. A technician came on 29th June 2019. He clicked a photograph of the bed and told that it was damaged at the time of installation as it is a bed that requires screws to be bolted and the damage was done in the place where the screw was put.I spoke to Flipkart the very same time and got the technician to talk to Flipkart for that as well (I have a call recording for the same). I was told that we will get the pick up done and issue refund for the same. I was okay with it. Now after 2 days when pick up was not done. I again called Flipkart and asked the status then the agent said ""The seller has arranged technician visit again and then we will pick up the order. I said ok. I receive a message that stated technician visit will take place in 3 days. Now, the same day evening I received another message stating ""Service is Completed"".I was amazed as nobody came to my place at all. Nobody called either. I then called Flipkart and further wrote an email to them stating what has happened. The agent I spoke to said, ""Sir, it is a technical error don't worry, the technician visit is still on"". After arguing over this for an hour I hung up the call and waited for the technician to come. But nobody came.I then wrote an email to their CS-HEAD team explaining everything, I got a reply from an Agent named ""NANDINI"" also a call from her she said to wait 48 hours she is looking into the issue. After 4 days I got a call again from her and she said ""Sir, the seller has approved the return, we will pick up your order and issue refund post pick up"" I said okay. This was said on 30th June 2019. I received a text message post that interaction from Jeeves again stating that product will be picked up and a technician was assigned. I called the technician on the number provided, he said "" Sir, we do not have anything to pack the product"" I have to send an email to the team to get approval for cardboard box otherwise I will get it from somewhere else, give me 2-3 days. I said okay. Every day I used to receive a message that uninstallation is rescheduled as per your request which was wrong. So, I waited till 08th July 2019 for them to arrange a cardboard box.Now, after 8 days that is today 08th July 2019. I got a call from the CS-HEAD AGENT NANDINI, who said Sir, your return has been rejected by the seller as they are saying that as per the second technician the damage was caused by you. I was shell shocked, as nobody came to my place to visit at all. She kept arguing and gave the same robotic speech that Sir, we are dependent on seller and the technician has said that it is your fault so, we will not be able to do anything. I was fuming with anger as Flipkart is literally trying to fool the customer. First of all, Nobody came to my house to look into the bed.Secondly, After committing on a recorded call that the product will be picked up and we will issue refund regarding the same. She was now giving wrong information. Third, she was saying she has no idea regarding technician visit and she is dependent on the seller for this. Well, the seller of the bed is FLIPKART ITSELF. (I have call recordings for the communications along with app screenshot and emails). The bed has been uninstalled by Flipkart on 8th July 2019 and is still lying in my bedroom packed.
