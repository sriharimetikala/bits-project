I've purchased a celeing fan and recived a wrong product so I complained and ask them to replace it. The next delivery I got the same wrong product with new packing. They are doing the same mistake againand  again. So I decided to give back this product and refund my amount. Still now I don't receive any calls or response from there part. It's like a cheeting. And this is the worst experience for me from this app.  I think Amazon I'd better than this. ..Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.\",\n",

The Offers they were providing is better then other Companies like Amazon and Other E-commerce WebsitesBut it take a Long period 8-12 days of time for Delivery which is not Acceptable but I don't have other choice I have to go for it cause my Budget range is Limited . After Receiving the product I feel so easy and Happy and the packaging is good but my experience of Flipkart is Not that Good so I recommend you to read the Conclusion part.ConclusionDelivery service is worst . You can shop from Flipkart if you have so much time or it only takes 2-3 for Delivery if not please don't shop from it use alternatives like Amazon and Etc.Stay safe Stay IndoorsPeace.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

        "  #                     \"Flipkart is one of the Top E-commerce website in India. Flipkart has always provided me fastet delivery within 3 days, (I belong to rural region, 3 days delivery is also fast for my location)The differs Flipkart from Other E-commerce website is their Promocodes, offers high discounts. Probably 95% of all my Online shopping is done through Flipkart.!Most of the times on other sites Price is shown more than MRP, But on Flipkart it is Same or Less than that MRP. Moreover all the needed products are available on Flipkart at affordable price.!Flipkart also offers you an opportunity for earning through affiliate marketing.Most of the times Payment is also a big issue. Flipkart offers a wide variety of payment methods and also refund is done within the stated time.Flipkart cares for the customer much seriously, takes feedback each and every time and solves the issues. This impressed me alot. O had given a suggestion to Flipkart, thought they will just read it and leave. But they read and implemented that suggestion. Amazing.!This is another kind of happiness that we can't express. A Billion dollar company takes your opinion and implements it within weeks.!Flipkart has Super Coin system which is also very good, my friend orders alot high prices products and gets super coins in respective ratios. Those products if had purchased from market will had cost him nearly 20-30% higher than purchased from Flipkart at discounted price. Moreover he had got alot super coins. Simply Sone pe Suhaga.!Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.\"\n",

              " (\"I had booked a flight from New Delhi to Raleigh on 16th July 2021(PNR: 2HJR75). The flight was from Qatar airways and I booked the flight through Flipkart travel. The flight route was New Delhi -> Doha -> Boston -> Raleigh for 6th August 2021. On 18th July 2021, I received an email from Qatar airways that my flight from Boston to Raleigh has been canceled. I contacted Qatar airways and they told me that as the flight was booked through Flipkart, so according to airlines policy Flipkart is responsible for rescheduling the flight. Then I contacted Flipkart and requested a connecting flight from Boston to Raleigh.Customer service executive told me that as the flight is booked under the same PNR, they cant provide a connecting flight from Boston to Raleigh, but they will reschedule the entire flight and will book a new flight from New Delhi to Raleigh with Qatar airways for 6th August 2021 and there will be no charges for rescheduling. I agreed to this and asked them to send the ticket by email. I didn't receive any email on 18th July. The next day, one of the customer executives called me and told me that there is no flight available on 6th August 2021 and we can check flights for 7th and 8th august. Unwillingly, I agreed to this and asked them to send the options available. They sent one option for 8th August 2021 on 19th July 2021 and within 20 minutes I asked them to reschedule to this date. Two hours after my confirmation, I received another call from Flipkart that there are no seats available on that flight and they told me that we will revert with more options. After one hour they called again and told me that no flight is available on specified dates and they asked if I am ok with a flight on 9th August 2021. Reluctantly, I said yes and asked for an itinerary. I did not receive any mail from them after that.The next day morning they called me and told me that there are no flights available till 15th August 2021. After that I checked Flipkart's portal for flights from Delhi to Raleigh between 6th and 8th August 2021 operated by Qatar Airways, I could find 6 flights. When I asked the customer support executive to book one of these flights he started asking for rescheduling charges up to Rs.100000 as the flight prices have hiked in the last two days. Finally, when I asked for a refund they told me that there will be cancellation charges and they can't refund the entire amount. Flipkart is providing no support and is trying to loot money from their customers. If I try to book the same flight today, it will cost me around Rs.265000. They are harassing me for the past 13 days. It's been 13 days that this issue has been raised.Every time I call customer care they tell me that the backend team will contact me within the next 24-48 hours, but I haven't received any response for the past 8 days. I asked for talking with the supervisor and I was told that I will receive a call within the next 2 hours and that didn't happen as well. On asking customer care to send a mail specifying the deadline of the issue resolution, the customer care executive says that they don't have access to send the e-mail. I have been calling customer care 3-4 times a day for the past 13 days regarding this issue.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.\",\n",

              " (\"I had booked a flight from New Delhi to Raleigh on 16th July 2021(PNR: 2HJR75). The flight was from Qatar airways and I booked the flight through Flipkart travel. The flight route was New Delhi -> Doha -> Boston -> Raleigh for 6th August 2021. On 18th July 2021, I received an email from Qatar airways that my flight from Boston to Raleigh has been canceled. I contacted Qatar airways and they told me that as the flight was booked through Flipkart, so according to airlines policy Flipkart is responsible for rescheduling the flight. Then I contacted Flipkart and requested a connecting flight from Boston to Raleigh.Customer service executive told me that as the flight is booked under the same PNR, they cant provide a connecting flight from Boston to Raleigh, but they will reschedule the entire flight and will book a new flight from New Delhi to Raleigh with Qatar airways for 6th August 2021 and there will be no charges for rescheduling. I agreed to this and asked them to send the ticket by email. I didn't receive any email on 18th July. The next day, one of the customer executives called me and told me that there is no flight available on 6th August 2021 and we can check flights for 7th and 8th august. Unwillingly, I agreed to this and asked them to send the options available. They sent one option for 8th August 2021 on 19th July 2021 and within 20 minutes I asked them to reschedule to this date. Two hours after my confirmation, I received another call from Flipkart that there are no seats available on that flight and they told me that we will revert with more options. After one hour they called again and told me that no flight is available on specified dates and they asked if I am ok with a flight on 9th August 2021. Reluctantly, I said yes and asked for an itinerary. I did not receive any mail from them after that.The next day morning they called me and told me that there are no flights available till 15th August 2021. After that I checked Flipkart's portal for flights from Delhi to Raleigh between 6th and 8th August 2021 operated by Qatar Airways, I could find 6 flights. When I asked the customer support executive to book one of these flights he started asking for rescheduling charges up to Rs.100000 as the flight prices have hiked in the last two days. Finally, when I asked for a refund they told me that there will be cancellation charges and they can't refund the entire amount. Flipkart is providing no support and is trying to loot money from their customers. If I try to book the same flight today, it will cost me around Rs.265000. They are harassing me for the past 13 days. It's been 13 days that this issue has been raised.Every time I call customer care they tell me that the backend team will contact me within the next 24-48 hours, but I haven't received any response for the past 8 days. I asked for talking with the supervisor and I was told that I will receive a call within the next 2 hours and that didn't happen as well. On asking customer care to send a mail specifying the deadline of the issue resolution, the customer care executive says that they don't have access to send the e-mail. I have been calling customer care 3-4 times a day for the past 13 days regarding this issue.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.\",\n",

My first order on Flipkart was Billion Powerbank 15000 mAh which is not so good but average performance given around 3 years gone when I had bought it. My second order was Philips Trimmer QT4011/15 running smoothly after 2 years and 6 months. My third order was Lois Caron watch which is also going great after 2 years. My fourth order was Sony ZX110A wired without mic Headphone which is also going very good after 10 months. My fifth order was Mi Rechargeable Led Lamp which is also going good after 20 days. So, these are the products I had bought from Flipkart 4 out of 5 are going great, the Powerbank one is little bit hit and miss I should have gone for some other. Delivery is also great on Flipkart in orders it indicates around 6 days order to come but, it comes within 4 days and Delivery Staffs are good. So, I recommend you to buy product from here but first do research on product then buy, don't buy blindly from someone's recommendation.Thank you.

Hence, British Airways cancelled the flight and informed me on 22/12/2020. Immediately said mail was sent to Flipkart for proceeding with the cancellation and initiation of refund. Even after rigorous follow-ups with them, Flipkart Travel always used to give assurance regarding the refund but till date, they have not refunded our money.Whenever I approached them, they used to insist to contact the airline and get the confirmation mail regarding flight cancellation. I have shared the same multiple times since 22/10/2020. However, they have not acted upon the cancellation. As per Flipkart's request, we even contacted British Airways also, but they mentioned that the flight has been booked with the travel agent(Flipkart), therefore I need to contact Flipkart only for resolution.

Immediately the ticket was closed saying issue resolved. Nobody contacted me again checking if it was resolved . The Kent dealer said they canâ\\x80\\x99t do anything for the product and asked me to courier it Chennai Kent service center. As it was glass kettle they charged me rs.650 courier charges for it . The product was sent in early Jan 2021. After a month I contacted the nearest dealer asking for updated . He said they will replace the product but the glass one is not available and only stainless steel is there but it cost extra money and I had to pay 600 more to get it . I said I canâ\\x80\\x99t pay extra money , if you donâ\\x80\\x99t have the same product. You can give my money back . They said wil discus and let you know . This happened around Jan 15th 2021.

In this week I received 10 calls from Flipkart, asking the same question again and again .

Though I had to wait for 3 months for the offer but its worth it.

Flipkart needs to work on it.and also flipcart needs to work on their customer services.its not bad but they need to improve it in regards to the refunding and that stuff.The good point is they provide wide range of products and covers almost every corner of country( I think that) . And its app version is better than website its easy to use and now they are adding many regional languages.for the product quality im completely satisfied. I got every product in perfect form. At least I got don't know about others. I would suggest you to buy products from popular companies for good quality and also check the review for the product before purchasing it.in case of delivery I won't say it is amazing like you get product within 2 or 3 days but it is satisfactory ( nowdays its may be late cause of covid 19) .

They are now china funded hence the quality of their product is also duplicate and defective.Their support service is worst in the industry line. Their return policy is worst on this planet and may be poorar than Mars.I wish on Mars they only give permission to companies like Amazon.Ban flipkatt5. Ban china. Ban chinese products and ban companies funded by China.I feel like just abusing them. I had my lifes worst experience with flipkart.1st of all they sell smuggled mobile where there is no IMEI number itself. 2nd on confirmation from their technician they still dont return or replace the mobile. The mobile is not detecting SIM from day 1 it arrived. No face recognition. Airplane mode by default showing half enabled half disabled. What kind of new devicr it was? And people whoever gives flipkart mote than 1star are all fake buyers and they r also imoorted from China.I am talking about Samsung Galaxy S20+. Please do not buy from Flipkart. Speciallu costly products as they first of all sell duplicate smuggled devices and on top of that if that doesnt work ur money is gone like i am stuck.

The product was delivered on October 21, 2020. Flipkart\\'s website shows that they would send a \"Brandâ\\x80\\x99s authorized service engineer to carry out the installation.\" A couple of people came and installed the AC and we also purchased from them stabilizers that would perfectly compliment the air conditioners.The air conditioners worked perfectly well until January 13, 2021. On that fateful day, one of the air conditioners(indoor part) fell off from the wall dragging the Stabilizer along with it. The machine was not even running at that time. Close to the wall was our bed. While the indoor unit fell on my 12-year-old son, the hefty stabilizer fell on me. The indoor unit also damaged the 5 feet X 6 feet canvas painting of my children hanging on the wall. It took a lot of time for me to come out of the shock.My initial move was to contact Samsung. To my surprise, I found that neither of my Samsung air conditioners was registered with them. They informed that the installation was not carried out by Samsung\\'s personnel. For this reason, they denied providing any sort of assistance since the problem was not with the machine but due to poor installation procedure carried out by the \"Brandâ\\x80\\x99s authorized service engineer\" sent by Flipkart.From then on, I am running from pillar to post to get this issue resolved but none of the Flipkart employees, be it regular customer service agents or the escalation team, care to resolve the issue. I have made and received many calls but none of the Flipkart personnel with whom I spoke had the intent to solve the issue.Leave alone showing intent to help me on this issue. When I called Flipkart initially and explained to them what had happened, they did not even were showing basic humanitarian concern to know about the safety of me and my kid. Kudos to Flipkart for letting me realize the divinity of customer service. After so many conversations with them, as of January 16, 2020, at 8:00 PM they are asking me to contact either Samsung or the \"Brandâ\\x80\\x99s authorized service engineer\" sent by Flipkart. I do not find any logic in calling either of them as the  \"Brandâ\\x80\\x99s authorized service engineer\" that was sent to mount the air conditioner was not my choice but Flipkart\\'s. And calling Samsung is out of the question because the issue itself is not about the product\\'s performance.I am attaching the pictures of the product showing the current scenario. If at all Flipkart wants to resolve this issue, I want some higher authority that can put himself/herself in my shoes and contact me with a solution. Surprisingly, it took them just a couple of seconds to remove the funds from my account but takes ages to find a resolution and I still wait for this multi-dollar company to help this simple man that had spent his hard-earned money.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

The item was no warranty cards no payment slip and no Ms. Angel AC outdoor unit inside the box. No one came for the installation after delivery; no message was received after delivery. Then later I contacted the LG Company for the installation. He said that it would take 4 to 6 days. Still, I am waiting. The best of these is that the item was delivered on time after the complaint.

They deliverd a kingstone sd card. the worst part is that the invouce which came with the item was not for the profuct delivered. The item I bought had a lifetime warranty.So the invoice is a necessity. So because of this, I raised a return request on the day itself of deliver.and informed their customer also over the phone. I asked them for an exchange gor the item I ordered.Also although the item I received was not that I ordered, I told them I could use the item if I could get the right invoice. both these request were denied by the.I kept on calling them and mailing them for the next 2 weeks to know the status of the issue. But nothing materialized. Every time I call they ask me what the issue is and I had to explain the issue all over again.The answer was all the same.Someone will contact you in 2-3 days.initially, this somebody used to call, but never gave a. solution.And latet on , that also stopped very unprofessional way.As some other reviewers have mentioned, This is like a Government office where they keeping on postponing and never find a solution.One year ag, I had purchased a blue star air conditioner from them. You wouldn't believe what I recieved.Got a fully damaged unit like it was from a junkyard which was full of dents on the outdoor unit, oil had leaked  from the compresssor which means there was no gas, and the indoor unit had parts missing.Fortunately, I had called the blue star authorized technicians for installatikn.They gave me a written report that the mavhine was damaged one. with all these papers I threatened them with legal actionif the case was not resolved immediately.So they budged. in that transaction I lost some money also, paying the technician who came to uninstal the AC. there is no coustomer service for them.they will offer you a very attractive price for what they sell and will lure you intro buying from them, But what you get they will decide.I don't know whether the item I recieved is genuine, becuse I have not opened the sealof the item hoping for them to take it back. it is a month now since I bought it. In the hope that they would to take it back, I bought what I wanted from another site after waiting for a week for the Diwali sale.and becuase I did notwant to deal with them anymore.I went ahead and purchased the card from them.at the time because theirs was  the best price and it was urgent for me.It was better that I wanted for the diwali sale and purchased it ftom a reliable site.They are cheats.Especially in these difficult times, how can a suoposed to be a reliable Indian company like flipkart cheat the coustomers of their hard-earned money.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

The handset was delivered on 21/10/2020 by Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx at around 13:00 to 14:00 hrs afternoon time. He has checked  OPPO K3 handset  IMEI NO:868649041625935(IMEI-1) with all respect and cross-checked IMEI of the handset as mentioned in order invoice inclosed. He appraised the good condition of my  OPPO K3 handset and collected the original charger adaptor and data cable along with Handset Cover provided by OEM duly mentioning that all such accessories required while the exchange of the product. Though I was at the office at that time my spouse asked him that these accessories are not required by Flipkart except handset but he insisted to collect all such accessories. So my spouse confirmed me the same on a phone call and I asked her to hand over all such accessories as useless for us as we got a new handset. Afterward Shri Manoj Kumar the Flipkart Wish master has handed over  Samsung Galaxy F41 IMEI/Serial No: 350265511557139 to my spouse and has taken the old OPPO K3 handset IMEI NO:868649041625935(IMEI-1) along with all the above accessories.In the evening I got the SMS from Flipkart backend at 18:24 hours regarding pick-up rejected(product mismatched) of OPPO K3 handset  Tracking id FMPR0138822260 due to details mismatch(Screenshot of SMS received from Flipkart backend at 18:24 hours attached) 05 hours after delivery of Product and collection of the old handset. Afterward, I had a telephonic conversation with  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx(call recording attached of 2.1 MB file no AUD-20201021-WA0002_ attached with this email) and while asking why product exchange pick-up rejected(product mismatched) of OPPO K3 handset he replied that he himself canceled the product and paid the exchange value of the  OPPO K3 handset of Rs6900/-as he required the handset because of handset good condition. When I asked him about his unethical/misconduct of product exchange cancellation he did not express any guilty feelings of his unethical misconduct. You requested to listen to the call recording carefully.After this conversation, I have checked the Flipkart app and the thing was confirmed that the pick-up OPPO K3 handset was canceled and the amount of Rs6800/- paid in cash as I did not pay anything in this transaction in cash towards rejection of the OPPO K3 handset hence I have realized that the pick-up  OPPO K3 handset had canceled purposefully by  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx. Afterward, I had called back him again and asked him to return the handset to the company( call recording attached of 3.2 MB file no AUD-20201021-WA0003_with this email) then he apologizes and asked me to speak with his Supervisor and both apologized for Shri Manoj Kumar misconduct. You requested to listen to the call recording carefully.That's Why Flipkart Wish master insisted to collect accessories of the OPPO K3 handset to use the handset duly maintaining in his custody unethically as well illegally. In such a scenario of  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx may misuse OPPO K3 handset 868649041625935(IMEI-1) duly making fraudulent/ransom calls. Hence I sincerely request you to kindly take appropriate action in this regard so that such instances will never have occurred in the future. You know very well that how serious the matter is and the reputation of Flipkart put on the burner because of such unethical & illegal act by your personnel duly misusing power/access provided by the company in such a scenario.So if  OPPO K3 handset IMEI NO:868649041625935(IMEI-1) is misused for making fraudulent/ransom calls in future then  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx, EKART &Flipkart will be solely responsible as do not take any appropriate action even almost 04 days since my complaint raised on Flipkart as on 21/10/2020.To avoid such instances in the future to provide the strict provision of OTP customer mobile number to validate such transaction(cancellation of Pickup of Old appliances and payment of balance amount) if any if required. If any problem occurs while generating OTP or delivering OTP to customer mobile due to technical reason/network outage then the same may be created by Flipkart customer care and after duly authentication same may be advised to the customer for completing such transaction. if the required OTP is not provided by the customer then the whole transaction should be canceled and a refund should be initiated duly charging penal amount if applicable.At last, my humble request to take all such necessary action in this regard to return  OPPO K3  868649041625935(IMEI-1) to the seller and refund amount if any paid by Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar Mobile/Contact number:0752308xxxx and confirm status as successfully picked up instead of existing; pickup canceled, and paid exchange amount in cash. I also requested to take consider fact that  Flipkart Wish master Shri Manoj Kumar is a very sincere & dedicated person. He delivers the products in my area for a long time with full dedication. But he committed a mistake without thinking about the consequences of such an unethical act in need of financial crisis post COVID19.So take only affirmative action to avoid such instances in the future instead of any action in vengeance.PS: Please go through all attached audio and .pdf files duly supporting my point of view in this incident of unethical cancellation of OPPO K3 Handset exchange by Flipkart Wish master without customer knowledge and unethical possession of handset with Flipkart wish to master.with regardsyours sincerelyMUDIT AGARWALMOB:700704xxxxFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

We bought extended warranty from Flipkart but they are not giving us service. Once our complaint is already closed saying issue is resolved but no technician visited at our place. They are doing fake closure of requests. It's Flipkart responsibility to provide us service as we bought extended warranty from Flipkart.  But when we call to Flipkart customer care they don't receive they call. And when we follow up with Jeeves customer care(company tie up with Flipkart for extended warranty) every time when we call they say technician will come in 48 hours. It's been a week now we are suffering from this issue. It's very frustrating and not acceptable. Flipkart is fake. Flipkart is fraud.

But recently I had placed OD120055373675841000 for 5 liter hand sanitizer on 26th October 2020. Delivery time was mentioned by 4th November.

Contacting customer support could not get any confirmation to receive the item on time. Hence today I have cancelled the order and placed fresh order on Amazon. My place is located near Kolkata, but most of the advertised items in Flipkart shows un-deliverable in my area as if it is in North East or some remote locality.

I wanted it badly so I started taking follow-up of courier 4 days before my final delivery date. On the delivery day I got message from Flipkart that parcel is getting two-three days late. It was 50km far from my city I was in such a need of that bag that I showed eagerness to collect that bag from that city. But their  delivery service did not contacted me. After taking this issue to flipakarts customer service they showed inability to interfere as they said we are not responsible and it is delivery services fault. Being a plus customer I did not expected  such a service from one of indias biggest online seller. It is very disappointing from flipkart. From now I have decided not to purchase anything from Flipkart and also I to anyone who is in emergency it's my friendly suggestion not to rely on flipkart.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

              " (\"Recently I(unfortunately) purchased a new Samsung washing machine( Samsung 6.2 kg ActivWash+ Fully Automatic Top Load Grey) and paid the amount online under exchange.The exchange price was Rs 1800/- for my old Samsung Top loading fully automatic machine.When the new machine arrived at my place, my old samsung washing machine was washing clothes and in use daily. So, the person waited as he saw it working.However later he called to someone and said there is rust on cover, so price is Rs 475/- and asked me to pay balance Rs 1325/-.  I tried contacting FK support and they informed me to place new order(i.e. cancel the order). I was astonished for this input.In good faith I paid cash Rs 1325 as new machine was as door step but protested strongly as it's cheating when old machine is working and washing clothes. But he did not care and it was like predecided from his interactions on phone to fail the machine(& not pass it). To me it was like cheating.I provided a pungent comment on the exchange document and shared with FK.Then next day, Samsung Service engineer visited and he said internally the machine is damaged. The photo of his findings on new machine were shared with FK. After sharing the visit details(fortunately I took job card photo), FK realised that visit is over but the service engineer did not punch those details in system. He called center and infront of him he asked me to go for cancellation/ refund in the FK application. With no choice left, have to apply for refund.So, FK said we will refund the machine amount & cash but Rs 475 will be FK coupons. I asked them give my old working machine back, but FK refused. Already paid Rs 100 for pickup.I am left with no washing machine as the new machine is damaged piece and my old working machine is taken back.So FK cheated me twice:cost of old working samsung machine was forced at Rs 475 when in local shop/market it typically fetches Rs 1000 - 1200Providing defective new washing machineApart from that, pain of contacting FK support, explaining the problem to FK support engineer again and again with no end as every time new person comes on callEven escalation mechanism did not help as they said why did you accept to pay the amount by cash, that means its your fault.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

As the one year warranty was over, had searched in whole Mumbai for purchase of a compatible remote. But no remote available is compatible with this brand. After repeated correspondence from February 2020 with an unresponsive customer care of  MarQ flipkart, it was informed in October 2020 that the company does not produce any spare remote which can be purchased by the customer. As no remote in market or MI phone is compatible with this unique brand of A.C, i am unable to use this A.C since November 2019 and now only option is to discard this unusable junk of equipment purchased with a good amount of money.Flipkart needs to look into this matter. The customer care of flipkart has simply passed onto MarQ and this brand is irresponsible towards customer support.So if this is the condition with the remote, just imagine the condition if there is any issue with the electronic parts in the MarQ A.C.So be careful in investing money in this product.

I requested for a manager callback a guy who doesn't speak English called me so he said someone else will call me back.

After cancelling the request he stated that the merchandise is no longer available and ended up blaming the seller for their incompetence and Flipkart can't do anything about it since it is the sellers fault.

I have nothing to do with the seller and I don't care who they are because I purchased the merchandise through Flipkart and paid Flipkart for it.

You know, the customer case said that both are not possible and I have to wait infinitely and no other option.I have mailed my situation to Flipkart management(got their email through some friends) and no response to my 3 emails to them. Then I have to draft a formal complaint to their CEO and after 4 days someone from Flipkart called me and told that the issue got escalated and they will resolve it immmediately.

The seller does only replacements, which is fine for a high ticket item. The machine arrived within stipulated timeline along with the Bosch guys who came for installation. The machine, when the box was opened by Bosch people had some broken parts and the door wasn't locking. They gave me their paper saying this isn't installable and needs to be replaced. When I tried replacing on flipkart, the only option available is return and refund. The process was initiated and then converted into a replacement 4-5 days later. In the meantime, needing a washing machine and convinced the one I've is going back, I bought a new one. Now they say only replacement and no return - my question is why did you allow for a return only and not a replacement only option when I was returning it! First you deliver a broken products(happens), then you force me to return it and then convert it into a replacement 5 days later because the seller doesn't say so! The fault, I believe, squarely lies with the Flipkart team and their process design people - had the option for replacement been available, I'd have taken it up and none of this would be happening!

However Jeeves informed me that they do not have any update from flipkart on my order yet. Once the order details from Flipkart to Jeeves is received, only then they can send the technician for installation and demo of the product.I have been chatting and calling flipkart multiple times from the time this product got delivered. Flipkart customer service only says that they will escalate this issue and nobody helps after this.Flipkart customer service agents over the phone only say that they can only escalate and cannot do much as they have very limited authority.I was also misguided that this product does not qualify for free installation. However, online on flipkart website, it states that the delivery and installation is free(Screenshot for reference).I am extremely frustrated talking to the flipkart customer service team as nobody is interested to support.Thanks and RegardsDinesh JainBangaloreFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

But my nightmare started when there was a defect found in the TV which was also highlighted by their own technician who came to fit the TV. On asking for a replacement (which is very well mentioned on their site) due to a malfunctioning product they asked me to take a refund (EMI for that product already charged by the bank to me during this time) as the product is out of stock. Somehow they don't mention this on the site while selling their item. And guess what the seller of the product is their very own  OmniTech Retail. They purposely kept buying time so that I not only loose on the introductory price but also on the initial extended warranty of the TV which was only for 6th to 10th Aug.I keep blaming myself on why I chose this sick site for purchasing a product which currently lies at my place which is of no use and also burnt so much of my time in dealing with their customer service which lacks knowledge skills.Moreover now they don't even let me share the reviews of the product on the site. I have snapshots to proove this and it gets submitted at my end yet never appears to all. Atleast by reading my review someone would aave their money and valuable time dealing with idiots.Moreover someone from Hisense calls me and tries to negotiate the ratings I have given on the product by offering me a repair on the problem (not replacement) .

I bought a â\\x80\\x98Flipkart perfect homes Viola Engineered Wood Queen Hydraulic Bedâ\\x80\\x99, selling price of the product was Rs. 23890 without discount I got it for Rs 14090.After 8 months of use the head portion support went down. When I checked it, all of the fitting whuch was made has came out ( nut bolts ).Very same day I raised a complaint against the product since product was still under warranty.Flipkart took the request and arranged the authorized partner to visit and check the status. The visiting person agreed saying that the product had fitting issue. My reply was â\\x80\\x98they were your people who made the fitting' how would I know how fitting has to be done.The person called his boss and provided him images of bed. Then the dealer spoke to me and said â\\x80\\x98 Sir we can't do anything since the bed is brokenâ\\x80\\x99 then I answered him The product is still under warranty, why can't you do anything. Next thing what he said is sir you could informed after installation then I replied â\\x80\\x98problem has occurred after 8 months, why do you expect complaint from me after installation â\\x80\\x98 then he said sir I will provide my update to flipkart. You can talk to them.After 1 hour I received a message saying dealer has completed its visit to your place. Sorry seller is unable to provide return request.I called flipkart then agents tells me sir if there is any material issue with product we can't do anything then i asked them â\\x80\\x98why are providing warranty on product?â\\x80\\x99 How does it make sense? If product has some issue then there is no repair or refund on product and the next movement my request was closed.All I want to say do not get into trap of flipkart. Buy furniture from somewhere else who provides you valuable service for product if any issue occurs.

Even if you filter out, the products will be mixed. There is no clear separation.Coming to the products, I had once ordered Puma sports shoes which out to be fake and when I complained about the same, they simply said you can exchange or return but that is real product. Point is not about exchanging but about flipkart sending fake products with Puma tagging.Now about exchange policy, that is fine just like any other platform.It is free and money is transferred back to you.But not all products can be returned.It depends on different sellers.Products can take anywhere between 3-15 days depending upon the seller and market demand.Customer support services are really bad. You have to call them atleast 10 times before they actually answer.Even after that it is not sure if they will solve your query.There are many sellers who also upload fake pictures and there is no mechanism to verify the genuineness.Overall, bad experience.Please choose Myntra or Amazon anyday over Flipkart.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

When I told him I'm returning the product he tried to fix the issue through remote access all the while indirectly questioning my claim asking me if my speakers and head phones are fine (I checked them with another computer). When he couldn't resolve the issue he said he'll send sound card. Initially I agreed but I realized he's delaying me so that the return period gets over. I raised the return request . Next day he called me multiple times and rudely told me to cancel the return request. He sent me message saying the same. I informed Flipkart about it and asked for refund. Flipkart completely ignored my request.Later that day I found that the product sent to me was returned by someone else(there was a return sticker on the box). I requested for a refund again as I lost trust on the seller, Flipkart ignored again.Meanwhile, Flipkart sent me a mail asking for a second payment for the returned good. I talked to a Flipkart agent who confirmed that I have to pay. It was the final straw. I told them I'll take legal action for consumer exploitation as they charged me twice for the same product, only then they retracted.I should have got compensation for this type of harrassment. I could let go of it all if the product I received was fully functional. Even the second product is defective.Hardware is cheap and flimsy, makes an ugly sound when turned on, sound is still defective (only one speaker plays), gets slow with handful of software.Windows is cracked version and needs reactivation in every 30 days.Conclusion: worst experience ever.

Upon opening the order I was shocked to see that the product inside was completely different, my original order was replaced with a broken multi-plug adapter. Had reported the issue as soon as I got the product delivered so that this could be traced back. The packing was torn from inside and a Replacement was ordered on 18th.I got a message on 20th June, that my replacement order(Replacement ID 12101893256625122777) was rejected by the seller. I am really shocked at this, I don't care if it is the seller or the delivery executive or the middleman in between handling the parcel who did this fraud, I simply need a replacement or refund of this product. Why will the seller or delivery executive accept that they did the fraud and have been replacing products for customers?The rejection of the replacement is a slap on my face and a message that I did a petty theft of a product worth Rs. 2599 and a question mark on myself on choosing Flipkart. Please don't ruin this relationship just because you don't have any control over your supply chain. Please don't become a fraud company that delivers empty promises to customers.I have been placing orders with Flipkart for the last 7years including some very costly products and this has never happened before. Please have a tighter control over your logistics and don't blame the customer for such issues.

I recently purchased a Nokia 43-inch television TV through flipkart. I had very high hopes about this purchase as it a new launch from Nokia and the features looked good on paper.The agony started after I took the delivery. I found that the USB port was faulty hence raised a replacement request from Flipkart. Flipkart scheduled a tech visit to ascertain the issue which turned to be a nightmare. I have a kid at home and we are extremely cautious about strangers walking in during this time of Pandemic. The Guy from Jeeves was horrible, he did not know what needs to be done nor there was any solution despite spending almost 2 hours in the house. The very next day Jeeves arranged some other technician for inspection, this time I was hoping for a resolution as my 10-day replacement was coming to end. To my surprise, after the inspection, I received a message from Jeeves saying that the tech visit could not be completed due to some reason.As I am writing this review, my replacement period is over. The only takeaway from this are a) Ridiculous service and torture by Jeeves and their staff b) Flipkartâ\\x80\\x99s laggard approach for resolution sometimes feel that they are intentionally doing it to slow the replacement process c) Lesson not to trust a failed brand like NokiaI have been purchasing from Flipkart for more than 10 years and this one experience has caused enough damage hence I would refrain from purchasing anything from them and also would discourage my friends and family.#Nokia43IncTV #NokiaFailedbrand #Flipkart #FlipkartNolongerCredible #Jeeves Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Even their delivery is also very nice compared to other shopping sites.Obe thing I appreciate flipkart is they will provide return and replacement policies for almost all products which is actually very good point. For clothes, shoes they will provide around 30 days return policy and for electronic accessories like mobiles and headphones etc they will provide 10 days replacement and return policy. But once they made a mistake.that is I ordered an arduino uno electronic circuit board with set of jumper wires. But at the delivery time I got only the jumper wires in the box but there was no arduino uno board in that box. We raised the complaints so many times but the issue was not at all resolved. So I kindly request flipkart team don't repeat the same thing. Another good point of flipkart is they will provide flipkart pay later option for the customers. By which the customer can by the product and pay the amount next month 10th. They have even provided flipkart pay later services for me of rupees 5500 but for some customers they will also provide 7000 rupees flipkart pay later option.

If you will talk about quality no one can count on it and claim it to be genuine. Flipkart is adding the dealers without having their proper background check and their outlet infection. It just wants to double its revenue by increasing the dealer's count.You never get the true information in your account regarding your order refund our delivery. You place the order and rest assure that you'll be getting the product on time as it's updated their but on the delivery date it's not delivered and you find yourself cheated.when you see the update in you account it remains the same even after your delivery date expires. When you call them then they simply say sorry and assure that will be delivered and give you some other date but no information changes in your account.After a couple of days before your delivery, you find your order is canceled. You never did it then who? You make a call in a hurry and get to know that the order is being canceled by the dealer and when you ask for the reason they have no clue.Refund policy: It' simply 1 to 15 days prior that forgets about it. Think you have already paid for your order. The things you have ordered in urgency as you needed them badly for meeting your daily needs but neither you have it nor the refund. You find yourself in a very miserable situation as you don't have what you wanted in time and also you have to purchase it again from somewhere else but where is the money if you have you purchase it from somewhere else and if not you wait for the refund and start an unending struggle with Flipkart.Please don't trust Flipkart and the quality of their products. Never trust and make orders just for saving some amount but getting mouth-watering discounts and other offers.Rather you should visit the nearest certified shops or dealers around you in search of products you want to have.

But 1st reason is because of its user interface it looks more attractive ya I know I doesn't matter a lot but still I like how flipkart website looks. Talking about shipping of products so it's just fine both Amazon and flipkart are equal in my locality. And the thing I like the most in flipkart is that mostly all newly launched electronic gadgets are launched in flipkart which gives us a early access to the product. And last but not the least thing is their 24/7 customer care which is always there to help us out and their service to customers are really good.

They will listen to leave your store tomorrow after leaving.  Pleasure.He greeted me within 10 seconds of entering the store, asked me how my morning had been, and to take advantage of this information to create a non-sales discussion and to make me feel at ease, he addressed my needs.  Set up, listened attentively, because I am going through the feet.  And knee rehabilitation.  Then Livvy explained what your in-store technology does and I had to run up-and-down the store in bare feet, setting up my price range ( $ 170-250) and what kind of sock ( thickness) I needed to be in the neutral trainer.  I run with my orthotic before putting in, repeating the recording process of running me and then transferring me to a light-backed shoe and recording what it is  Was happy Ndu that reflect how things video.Throughout the process, he kept the technical conversation at a level that I could easily understand and follow and also keep the pace of the original non-sales conversation rolling through the process.I simply cannot praise the level of service and knowledge that I have received today.  If I were an NSM, I would have devoted such talent, my life would have been very stressful.

The shoe rack had very good reviews which made me order the same but to my shock when it arrived it was half torn and the quality( even if it were not torn) was that of a dishrag!!! I instantly filed a return request. Now Flipkart has designed the return request form in a way that selecting a reason for return is mandatory from a drop down menu. I selected manufacturing defect and wrote in comments as additional poor quality. The return request was accepted and a pick up date of on or before 3days later was given. Surprisingly no one showed up on the given date and no notification(text/email) came. I logged into my account to see that the seller has rejected the request. I called the customer service and the guy told that the \"seller didn\\'t like the comments selected\". I was dumbstruck!!! And hence the seller rejected your request. The guy had nothing else to say. I was very angry but decided to re-raise the request. Similar to the previous one, i was given a date of by or before next 3 days. But yet again no one showed up. This time not even text saying \"out for pick up\". When i called customer service, may be 3 times. They told me to wait till 7pm. Post 7pm, i called again. This lady, a so called \"flipkart customer executive\" had no idea of her own organization\\'s business policies and told me that based on the selection of my comment from the drop down menu, the seller will decide whether to pick up the product or not.

They don't give a damn for the customer. Following is my review on Flipkart which they did not publish online.''Got the product on time but it was a size smaller, guess should have ordered a size bigger for this particular model!Put in a request for return, courier boy turned in and said he can't take the shoes back because the price tag is missing. I explained to him that the price tag was not there in the first place. It only had the brand tag and genuine leather logo in a plastic string on the shoe. He asked me to raise a complaint with Flipkart.I called Flipkart and told them I want to return my shoes. I was told the price tag has to be there and it was there in the box and checked by Packers before shipping. I replied I did not find any price tag in the box but there is a sticker with price, model, size and bar code on side of the shoe box. But the cs rep declined to return it and the matter was escalated to a team'.During the next few days got 3 calls from the team and they said the same thing.I understand the policy that price tag has to be there, but couldn't the seller have made a mistake and missed packing the price tag with the shoe? I got the feeling that Flipkart meant to say I am lying, that the price tag was there as stated by the seller! Ridiculous, probably the seller wants to clear inventory and comes up with such excuses to not return the product. Seller probably has a policy of once out never in! LolLooks like Flipkart has grown so big that it no longer cares for customer satisfaction. My money is down the drain and Flipkart lost a customer.Thank you for reading,Deepak''Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.\",\n",

              " (\"Hi - The seller retailnet is a fraud and cheating seller. I bought the product Samsung Fit e band for my son as birthday gift. I paid 2241 after 10% discount for the HSBC CC. The seller sent a package through Ekart ref # FMPP0452120897t on 3rd Mar 2020. However, when we opened the outer carton, we found that the inner package tamper seal was opened and the Samsung Fit e band was missing and only the charging cable and user manual only inside inner package.  We checked the outer courier carton and the outer package was fine. So, it's the seller who would have opened the tampered seal and removed the package and sent the product to cheat the buyer. We have raised the complaint with Flipkart immediately and they registered the complain as return request and immediately  in 10 mins closed  the complaint stating seller rejected the return request. I have again  raised the complaint on phone and I was told it will be investigated by concerned dept and will be addressed by 7th Mar 2020. I have not received any response till 7th March, and I contacted the Flipkart over phone and the customer care executive Mr Rohit was careless and simply told me that seller rejected the complaint and asked to send email complaint to csatflipkart.com and I got an email stating the cs email id is not in use.  Its unfortunate to note that the customer care executive mentioned that Flikart is not responsible to resolve these issue and it only facilitates buyers and sellers to deal with and they can not help buyer if seller cheats the buyer. I have been prime member and frequent buyer on Amazon for 5 years and I never faced such issue with any seller on Amazon and even if any product gets delivered with damage, Amazon customer care people resolve the problem and initiate replacement or refund. But Flipkart so pathetic and does not even want to resolve issue. This is clearcut fraud and cheating by seller through Flipkart facilitation. I would go for consumer protection but wanted to share my experience here so that other buyers will be more careful while dealing with Flipkart. My experience taught me to take video of unboxing the parcels received from these online sellers so that it would be a solid evidence when we fight in consumer court. I hope Flipkart would resolve my issue soon. Thank youFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.\",\n",

An authority of the Service of Business gave this data The legislature presented new standards in February with the target of securing the interests of 13 crore individuals subject to little retailers by the alluring offers made on web based shopping. These standards constrained web based business organizations to change their business structure, despite the fact that the US condemned it. Simultaneously there was expanded pressure in the business relations among India and America.On this issue, Amazon and Flipkart were continually looking at agreeing to all the standards, while nearby business associations affirmed that the two organizations are charging colossal add up to give limits during the ebb and flow happy season. Now and again, in excess of 50 percent markdown has been given. As indicated by sources, Flipkart offers to forgo commissions to merchants offering limits on items now and again. Business Service authorities said the administration is examining the grievances and the proof gave by the Confederation of All India Dealers (CAIT), which had blamed Amazon and Flipkart for abusing outside speculation rules. CAIT speaks to 70 million retail brokers in the country.Sales of retail dealers diminished by 40 percent It is significant that last week, delegates of Amazon, Flipkart and CAIT met before the Business Service to examine this issue. CAIT general secretary Praveen Khandelwal stated, \"Because of substantial limits, clients are shopping on the web. Because of this, the offers of retailers have descended by 30 to 40 percent this month.Flipkart offered a rebate to dealers As indicated by two messages from Flipkart venders in September, the organization offered incomplete installment of limits only days before the bubbly season. As per an email, \"In the event that the dealer diminishes the cost of the item by 15%, at that point the organization will bear 9% trouble if there should be an occurrence of 3% or 30% discount.\"A source related with Flipkart said that all the impetuses are under Indian principles and are proposed to urge merchants to gain by lessening the commission they pay.Unfair advantages to certain sellers! The All India Online Merchants Affiliation said in an explanation that around 100 of its individuals have exploited Flipkart\\'s fractional discount, making undue preferred position a few venders.

              " ('I ordered Motorola Moto E6s handset from flipkart.com, on 19-Jan-20, which was delivered to me on 20-Jan-20. As the bottom part of the phone, the display has a grey patch of around 1.5 to 2 inches, I requested for a replacement of the same on 21-Jan-20.Accordingly, a technician\\'s visit was scheduled for 22-Jan-20. The technician Mr. Adarsh from jeeves.co.in did accept that the display was \"faulty\", however, he misinformed me regarding the procedure of return. As per him, he uploaded the pictures of the faulty display that he clicked on his phone to their portal and that I would get a status update from Flipkart within two hours of him uploading the pictures. This was the first time ever, that a technician visit was scheduled for a problem I faced. Moreover, flipkart.com had not given me any details regarding the procedure to be followed, rather the precautions to be taken while handing over the phone to the technician, hence, I believed in whatever information he provided to me.However, as soon as he stepped out of my house, notwithstanding what he told me regarding the faulty display, he cunningly and arbitrarily rejected my request for a replacement. As soon as I found out about it, I called Flipkart toll free customer care number 18008899898 and informed them about the issue at length. I also specifically complained about Mr. Adarsh, and asked their customer care executives to make a note of his name in my complaint, and take the strictest action against him for uploading fake details.Thereafter, another technician visit was scheduled which was to take place on or before 27-Jan-20. Accordingly, another technician Mr. Satish from jeeves.co.in called on 24-Jan-20 and asked to come the same day. As I was busy on that day, I asked him to come on 25-Jan-20, to which he agreed. Accordingly, I got an SMS from VKjeeves confirming that the appointment was rescheduled to 25-Jan-20 at 12:00 pm.As the technician did not visit my site till 12:00 pm on 25-Jan-20, I called back on the number +912271872225 from which he had called on 24-Jan-20. Ironically, this call was received not by Mr. Satish but by Mr. Adarsh against whom I had complained. Over the phone, he once again lied to me that my request for replacement was rejected because I had not backed up the data in my phone. If that was the case, then he should have informed me about it. I would have done a factory reset right in front of him. In my case, the phone display is faulty, in some other cases, the display could be broken or the back cover could be broken. In all these cases, is data backup a mandatory requirement? As I could no longer take his lies, I told him to send Mr. Satish for a site visit instead of him. He once again very rudely remarked that Mr. Satish is busy at the moment and will come if he gets time.On the same day i.e., on 25-Jan-20 at 17:01 hours, I got another call from +912271872225 from Mr. Pervez Ansari (not sure if it is spelled as Pervez or Parvez). According to him, Mr. Adarsh asked him to visit me instead of Mr. Satish. During our phone call, he divulged a VERY IMPORTANT & CONFIDENTIAL piece of information regarding their performance rating. As per the information provided by him, their performance is rated \"GOOD\", if they \"REJECT\" the customers\\' requests for replacement and vice versa. Further, he has also confessed that the genuineness or otherwise of the customers\\' complaints has no bearing on whether their request for replacement will be \"ACCEPTED\" or \"REJECTED\". It is purely on the basis of the \"REPORT\" provided by them.The second technician visit NEVER HAPPENED and on the morning of 26-Jan-20, I learned that my request for replacement has been rejected. During this period I spoke with several of their customer care executives. A few of them being Ashish (22-Jan-20), Vishnu (23-Jan-20), Neelam (25-Jan-20), Aditya (25-Jan-20), Sanjay (25-Jan-20), Abhishek (25-Jan-20), Paramjeet (26-Jan-20). All of them say only one thing: \"Aap nishchint rahiye. Aapki puri sahayta ki jaayegi\", without giving a damn about the customer\\'s problems. In my opinion, as a cost-saving measure, they should just program to repeat this every 30 seconds in their IVR, instead of hiring and paying for these employees.Also, after logging into my account, going to my orders page, and selecting the appropriate order, I have raised issues several times with this product. Miraculously, all of them get resolved, without any intimation to me!!!!On searching the internet regarding jeeves.co.in, I have found that many of the directors are associated with Flipkart.From all of the above, I infer the following:1) It is very likely that the products sold on Flipkart as \"NEW\" could be \"REFURBISHED\", and hence \"DEFECTIVE\".2) Flipkart and jeeves.co.in are associated companies3) Flipkart and jeeves.co.in through their technicians COLLUDE TO CHEAT CUSTOMERS BY REJECTING THEIR GENUINE REQUESTS FOR REPLACEMENT OF FAULTY PRODUCTS4) The technicians have powers more than judges of High Courts and Supreme Court to give the one-sided report, without requiring the customers\\' sign-off5) The only way to get your request for replacement approved by the technician is to give them a handsome BRIBE. That is the only thing that will make them go against their employers.I want the following:1) Return pick-up of the faulty product and a full refund of Rs. 6, 499/-.2) Return pick-up and refund of the accessories bought along with the product viz., scratch guards/tempered glasses (2 units of Rs. 99/- each)3) Strict action against all the three technicians viz., Mr. Adarsh, Mr. Satish, and Mr. Pervez Ansari with intimation to me.4) Strict action against all of your above customer care executives viz., Ashish, Vishnu, Neelam, Aditya, Sanjay, Abhishek, Paramjeet.Thanks,MandarFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

I got really angry as when I asked in store, they were giving me an exchange of 3500 for the screen scratch, Flipkart is blindly charging.

I ordered a laptop key board skin through flipkart and initially selected the payment mode as cash on delivery(COD) but as the product reached the destination delivery center they enabled the option of payment through the Debit / Credit card or any other payment system available. Now I made the payment of the product through the debit card on the day of delivery as I was short of exact change and it got debited successfully from my bank account. But after the payment was done the flipkart app started displaying me message saying that \"Payment was successful. But we are awaiting confirmation from our courier partner\".

I shared the pictures of my phone with them and without any comment validating any problem with my device they just denied my request claiming it to be company policy.The phone was out of stock the next moment, but I was able to do a successful transaction after some time on the official realme website with the mobile exchange.I've done several online transactions on Amazon even the mobile exchange ones, sometimes the cost might be a little bit more when compared to Flipkart, but I never faced any bad service or unjust treatment from amazon.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

It was Prepaid by Credit card worth Rs. 11710/-. Order number is OD117173711085622000. This order was placed from 8521975695 and mail id is kumarasutosh2014@gmail.com. Since we found that it was defective product so we mark return policy on Flipkart on 12th Dec where we were intimated for return approval and it was supposed to be picked up before 25th Dec but without any prior intimation this return policy got cancelled. Again it has been marked for return but this time it has been mentioned 17th Jan 2020. Tell me what is guarantee that this time it won't be cancelled and who has authorized you guys to do whatever you wish without customer knowledge.When we do purchase anything we do get proper notification but while cancellation of anything why we don't receive any notification. This repeat incidents shows lethargic attitude of Flipkart towards their valuable customer. Really unable to understand what happened to Flipkart these days.Yesterday I had telecom communication with Customer care executive, in spite of presenting any solution always they do say SORRY. Now their or your SORRY can't resolve my issue and this time Rs. 11710/- is not a small amount and I believe this amount can be salary of your junior level employee, isn't it?This is high time that's why I have to write mail today. We are quite valuable customer for Flipkart since long time back. You can check our number's in your system if you have data such as 9065490396, 7549052127 etc. Being as Corporate company you can't do anything wrong with your any of customer.Now request you to revert me on mail when you guys are going to refund our payment? You do refund this amount and pick up your stuff whenever you want.Looking forward quick and positive response or else we can proceed further to Consumer forum for legal notice.

I've purchased a celeing fan and recived a wrong product so I complained and ask them to replace it. The next delivery I got the same wrong product with new packing. They are doing the same mistake againand  again. So I decided to give back this product and refund my amount. Still now I don't receive any calls or response from there part. It's like a cheeting. And this is the worst experience for me from this app.  I think Amazon I'd better than this. ..Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.\",\n",

The Offers they were providing is better then other Companies like Amazon and Other E-commerce WebsitesBut it take a Long period 8-12 days of time for Delivery which is not Acceptable but I don't have other choice I have to go for it cause my Budget range is Limited . After Receiving the product I feel so easy and Happy and the packaging is good but my experience of Flipkart is Not that Good so I recommend you to read the Conclusion part.ConclusionDelivery service is worst . You can shop from Flipkart if you have so much time or it only takes 2-3 for Delivery if not please don't shop from it use alternatives like Amazon and Etc.Stay safe Stay IndoorsPeace.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

        " (\"Flipkart is one of the Top E-commerce website in India. Flipkart has always provided me fastet delivery within 3 days, (I belong to rural region, 3 days delivery is also fast for my location)The differs Flipkart from Other E-commerce website is their Promocodes, offers high discounts. Probably 95% of all my Online shopping is done through Flipkart.!Most of the times on other sites Price is shown more than MRP, But on Flipkart it is Same or Less than that MRP. Moreover all the needed products are available on Flipkart at affordable price.!Flipkart also offers you an opportunity for earning through affiliate marketing.Most of the times Payment is also a big issue. Flipkart offers a wide variety of payment methods and also refund is done within the stated time.Flipkart cares for the customer much seriously, takes feedback each and every time and solves the issues. This impressed me alot. O had given a suggestion to Flipkart, thought they will just read it and leave. But they read and implemented that suggestion. Amazing.!This is another kind of happiness that we can't express. A Billion dollar company takes your opinion and implements it within weeks.!Flipkart has Super Coin system which is also very good, my friend orders alot high prices products and gets super coins in respective ratios. Those products if had purchased from market will had cost him nearly 20-30% higher than purchased from Flipkart at discounted price. Moreover he had got alot super coins.
